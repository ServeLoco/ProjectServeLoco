# Multi-Area — Execution Checklist

Companion to [`multi-area.md`](./multi-area.md). That file is the **contract** (why, locked
decisions, performance/DRY/data-safety rules). This file is the **do-list**.

Branch: `feat/multi-area-super-admin` · 31 tasks (0–30) · Status: **NOT STARTED**

## Rules

1. Read `multi-area.md` §2 (locked decisions), §3 (performance), §4 (DRY), §6 (data safety) and
   §9 (hurdles) **before TASK 0**. Every `§x.y` below points there.
2. Tasks run **in order**. Later tasks assume earlier ones landed.
3. One commit per task, format `feat: AREA TASK <n> — <short title>`.
4. After every backend task: `npm test` in `apps/api`, then `npx eslint` on each file touched.
   A task is not done if either fails.
5. Tick each subtask as you go; tick the task heading with a one-line note when the whole task lands.
6. **Do not invent scope.** If a subtask seems to require touching something in the spec's
   DO-NOT-TOUCH list, stop and ask.
7. Response shapes stay byte-identical for a single-area install until TASK 27. Where a response
   already duplicates camelCase + snake_case, keep duplicating.

## Phase 0 — Safety gate

### [~] TASK 0 — Production snapshot + migration rehearsal
**Spec:** §6.1, §6.2, §9 · **Files:** `[ci] .github/workflows/ci.yml`, staging only
**Status note (2026-08-01):** 0.1–0.6, 0.8–0.9 need real production/staging access this session
doesn't have — deferred to whoever runs the actual prod deploy. Only 0.7 (CI step) done here.
Instead rehearsed TASK 1–3 twice against the **local dev DB** (`serveloco`, not synthetic-empty:
9 products / 79 orders / 6 users / 1 shop) and took a `mysqldump` snapshot first. Row counts
verified unchanged after both runs. This is not a substitute for 0.1–0.6 against production.

- [ ] 0.1 Full MySQL dump of production + full Mongo dump. Verify each **restores** on a scratch
      instance — an unverified dump is not a backup.
- [ ] 0.2 Record baseline row counts for every table in §1.1 and
      `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders` + `information_schema.TABLES` data length for `orders` (H12).
      Write the numbers into this file under 0.9.
- [ ] 0.3 Restore the snapshot to a staging MySQL. Point a staging API at it.
- [ ] 0.4 Write TASK 1–3's migration code locally, run it against staging. Not against an empty dev
      DB — production's real edge cases (NULL `shop_latitude`, legacy `products.image_id`, duplicate
      images) are the point.
- [ ] 0.5 Re-run row counts. Every table must match 0.2 exactly. Any delta = stop.
- [ ] 0.6 Run the migration a **second time** against the now-migrated staging DB. Must complete
      clean — this proves the `IF NOT EXISTS` / `ensureColumn` idempotence that production boot
      depends on (§6.1).
- [x] 0.7 `[ci]` Added to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, after "Install dependencies" and before
      "Run Tests": two `npm run db:migrate` steps (first pass + idempotence pass) against the
      MySQL service container, with the env vars `config/env.js` requires (`JWT_SECRET`,
      `ADMIN_OWNER_ID`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) added since migrate.js now seeds a super_admin.
- [ ] 0.8 Time the staging migration. If it exceeds the acceptable deploy window, plan a maintenance
      slot before TASK 3 rather than discovering it on boot.
- [ ] 0.9 Record here: `orders` rows = ____, data length = ____, migration duration = ____.

**Done when:** two consecutive clean migration runs on a production-shaped DB, zero row-count drift,
CI runs migrate twice and is green.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 0 — migration rehearsal + CI migrate step`

---

## Phase A — Foundations (no behaviour change)

### [x] TASK 1 — `areas` table + seed Area 1
**Spec:** §2.1, §2.12 · **Files:** `[api] src/db/migrate.js`

- [x] 1.1 `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS areas` — `id`, `code VARCHAR(16) UNIQUE`, `name`,
      `active TINYINT DEFAULT 1`, `is_default TINYINT DEFAULT 0`,
      `timezone VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT 'Asia/Kolkata'`, `min_lat/max_lat/min_lng/max_lng DECIMAL(10,7)
      NULL`, `catalog_version BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`, `brand_color VARCHAR(9) NULL`,
      `logo_image_id INT NULL`, `features JSON NULL`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- [x] 1.2 Index `(active, min_lat, max_lat)` for the bbox prefilter (§3.2).
- [x] 1.3 `INSERT IGNORE` seed row: `id=1, code='A1', name='Area 1', is_default=1`.
- [x] 1.4 Confirmed nothing reads the table yet — purely additive.

**Done when:** migrate runs twice clean, `SELECT * FROM areas` returns exactly one row, `npm test`
green. **Verified locally** 2026-08-01 against `serveloco` dev DB — both true.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 1 — areas table + seed Area 1`

### [x] TASK 2 — `admins` table + per-admin session state
**Spec:** §2.9 · **Files:** `[api] src/db/migrate.js`

- [x] 2.1 `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admins` — `id`, `username VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE`,
      `password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`, `role ENUM('super_admin','area_admin') NOT NULL`,
      `area_id INT NULL`, `display_name`, `active TINYINT DEFAULT 1`, timestamps.
- [x] 2.2 FK `area_id → areas(id)`; index `(active, area_id)`.
- [x] 2.3 `ensureColumn('admin_auth_state', 'admin_id', 'admin_id INT NULL')`. Row `id=1` keeps
      working as the legacy global revoke.
- [x] 2.4 Seed one `super_admin` row from `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (or bcrypt-hashed `ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
      whichever is set) **only when `admins` is empty**. Verified locally: seeded on first run,
      silently skipped on second run.
- [x] 2.5 Application-level invariant documented as a comment above the `admins` seed insert
      (`area_id: NULL` for the seeded `super_admin`); enforcement at the endpoint is TASK 24 — not
      yet built, so nothing stops a hand-written INSERT from violating it today. Flagging this as a
      real gap until TASK 24 lands, not just a checklist formality.

**Done when:** migrate idempotent, one seeded super admin exists, existing admin login unaffected.
**Verified locally** 2026-08-01 — `admins` has exactly one `super_admin` row (`area_id NULL`) after
two runs; `adminController.js` login not yet touched (TASK 7) so existing login is provably
unaffected — it doesn't read this table yet.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 2 — admins table + per-admin session state`

### [x] TASK 3 — `area_id` columns, backfill, indexes, UNIQUE key rewrites
**Spec:** §3.3, §3.6, §6.2, H1, H11 · **Files:** `[api] src/db/migrate.js`, `src/db/seed_demo.js`

> The riskiest task in the project. Follow the order literally — each step exists because
> reordering it loses data (§6.2).

- [x] 3.1 Added `ensureColumnAtEnd(table, name, definition)` — same existence check as
      `ensureColumn` but **no `AFTER` clause**. `ensureColumn` itself untouched.
- [x] 3.2 Added nullable `area_id INT` **at end of row** to all 19 tables via a shared
      `AREA_SCOPED_TABLES` list (single source of truth reused by every step below — avoids the
      table list drifting between the column/backfill/NOT-NULL/FK loops).
- [x] 3.3 Backfilled each to `1` in **5,000-row batches**, `ORDER BY id LIMIT 5000`,
      `WHERE area_id IS NULL`, looped until `affectedRows === 0`. Outside any transaction.
- [x] 3.4 Orphan check (`assertNoAreaOrphans`) run per table before NOT NULL — throws and aborts
      the whole migration on any violation. Verified locally: 0 orphans on every scoped table.
- [x] 3.5 `MODIFY area_id INT NOT NULL` only after the orphan check passes (checked
      `IS_NULLABLE` first so re-running after it's already NOT NULL is a no-op, not an error).
- [x] 3.6 FK `area_id → areas(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT` on all 19, via `ensureForeignKey` (same
      rethrow-unless-duplicate pattern as the existing `delivery_zones` parent FK). Verified: 19
      `fk_*_area` constraints present in `information_schema`.
- [x] 3.7 Old global UNIQUE keys dropped **before** the new composite on all 5: `categories.slug`,
      `store_modes.slug`, `coupons.uniq_live_coupon_code`, `dashboard_sections.idx_section_store_slug`,
      `admin_notifications.uniq_admin_inbox_event`. Verified via `SHOW INDEX` — none of the old
      global keys remain, all 5 new per-area composites present.
- [x] 3.8 All 12 composite indexes from §3.3 added (`ensureIndex`, reused from the existing helper
      already in scope in this function). Verified present via `SHOW INDEX`.
- [x] 3.9 Confirmed `orders.idx_status` / `idx_created_at` **not** touched — grepped the diff.
- [x] 3.10 Added `users.last_area_id INT NULL` via `ensureColumnAtEnd` — no FK (§2.2: cache only,
      areas are deactivate-only per §6.8 so it can never dangle).
- [x] 3.11 **Deviated from the literal wording, documented in a code comment why:** backfilled
      `last_area_id = 1` for every user with ≥1 order, rather than actually running each user's
      most recent order's lat/lng through a zone matcher. Reason: the polygon matcher
      (`matchZone`/`areaScope.js`) doesn't exist until TASK 6, and — more fundamentally — the §6.6
      gate means **only Area 1 can exist** at the point this backfill ever runs for real, so
      "match against zones" and "= 1" produce an identical result. Real per-request resolution
      takes over from TASK 6 onward; this is a one-time historical seed, not the resolution path.
      Verified locally: 4/6 users (those with orders) got `last_area_id = 1`, 2 stayed `NULL`.
- [x] 3.12 `seed_demo.js` — all 10 INSERT statements (`settings`, `offers`, `categories`×2,
      `products`×3, `orders`, `order_items`×2, `coupons`) updated to stamp `area_id = 1`.
- [x] 3.13 Confirmed `daily_order_counters` untouched in this task.
- [x] 3.14 Row-count comparison re-run against the **local dev DB** (not production/staging — see
      TASK 0 status note): `products=9, orders=79, users=6, shops=1` before and after, unchanged.

**Done when:** migrate runs twice clean, zero NULL `area_id` anywhere, row counts unchanged,
`npm test` green. **All true, verified locally** 2026-08-01. `npm test`: 85 suites / 919 tests
passed (mocked DB, so this proves application code is unaffected, not migration correctness —
that's what the two live runs above proved). `npx eslint` clean on both touched files.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 3 — area_id columns, backfill, indexes, unique key rewrites`

### [x] TASK 4 — Area-aware caches
**Spec:** §3.4 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/microCache.js`, `src/utils/storeMode.js`,
`src/controllers/settingsController.js`, all current cache callers, `tests/microCache.test.js`

- [x] 4.1 `microCache.js`: `set()` validates `<namespace>:<areaId>:<rest>` (or bare
      `<namespace>:<areaId>`) via regex, throws outside `NODE_ENV=production`. `get()` deliberately
      stays lenient — a malformed/missing read key just misses the cache rather than crashing a
      request; only writes are validated, since that's where a bad key actually gets baked in.
- [x] 4.2 `bust(namespace, areaId)` matches the exact `namespace:areaId` key plus everything under
      `namespace:areaId:`, with a trailing-colon guard so area 1 can't accidentally sweep area 10's
      keys via a naive substring prefix. `bust(namespace)` with no areaId kept as the original
      plain-`startsWith` global fallback.
- [x] 4.3 `MAX_ENTRIES` 100 → 600, exported.
- [x] 4.4 `settingsController`: internal `settingsKey(areaId)` helper, hardcoded to area 1 via a
      named `SETTINGS_AREA_ID_STOPGAP` constant at all 3 internal read/write sites.
      `bustSettingsCache` stays zero-arg (its 2 external callers — `shops.js`, `riders.js` — aren't
      touched in this task; that's real DB scoping, deferred to TASK 15).
- [x] 4.5 `storeMode.js`: internal `cacheKeyForArea(areaId)` helper, same stopgap pattern.
      `normalizeStoreType`/`invalidateStoreModeCache`/`getActiveStoreModeSlugs` keep their existing
      zero-arg signatures — their 9 external callers across the codebase are untouched; the
      underlying query itself isn't area-scoped yet (that's TASK 11, H4).
- [x] 4.6 Every `microCache` caller updated to pass `1` explicitly — found via
      `grep -rln "microCache" src/`, not by only checking the files the checklist named. That grep
      caught 2 files the plan missed (`shopAdminController.js`, `shopOwnerController.js`), which is
      exactly why the grep-first approach matters more than trusting a file list. Final verification:
      `grep -rn "\.bust(" src/ | grep -v microCache.js | grep -vE "bust\('[a-z-]+', "` returns nothing
      — no caller left without an explicit areaId argument.
- [x] 4.7 Rewrote `tests/microCache.test.js`: per-area bust isolation, the area-1-vs-area-10
      substring-collision guard, bare `namespace:areaId` busting, malformed-key throw (and the
      production bypass), lenient `get()`, and `MAX_ENTRIES` eviction at the new 600 threshold.
      11 tests (was 5).

**Done when:** single-area behaviour unchanged, cross-area bust isolation covered by a test.
**Verified locally** 2026-08-01: `npm test` 85/85 suites, 925/926 (1 pre-existing skip) passed;
`npx eslint` clean on every touched file; booted the real dev server against the migrated local DB
and hit `/api/categories`, `/api/dashboard`, `/api/delivery-zones`, `/api/settings` live — all
returned real cached data with no errors.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 4 — area-aware caches`

### [x] TASK 5 — Guardrail test, before the sweep
**Spec:** §4.6 · **Files:** `[api] tests/areaScoping.test.js` (new)

- [x] 5.1 Static scan of `src/controllers`, `src/services`, `src/utils`. Implementation note: rather
      than a bare text search, it finds every `.query(` call, captures its full (paren/bracket/
      brace/string-aware) argument text, and checks that against a per-table
      `\b(?:FROM|JOIN|UPDATE|INTO)\s+\`?table\`?\b` regex — precise enough that `orders` doesn't
      false-positive on `order_items`, `combos` doesn't on `combo_items`, `products` doesn't on
      `product_variants` (covered by its own test). When the query is passed as a bare variable
      (`pool.query(query, params)`) rather than an inline literal, it widens the search to the
      enclosing function body (found via brace-balance scanning from the nearest function-start
      marker) since that's where the `let query = ...` / `query += ...` building actually lives —
      falls back to the whole file if no enclosing function is found, a safe over-approximation.
- [x] 5.2 Fails any `.query()` call referencing a `SCOPED_TABLES` entry whose search text contains
      no `area_id` (case-insensitive).
- [x] 5.3 Allowlist mechanism built (`{file, line, reason}`, checked before flagging) but **left
      empty** — every table in the spec's suggested allowlist (`users`, `images`,
      `notification_templates`, `product_library`, etc.) is a table that never enters
      `SCOPED_TABLES` in the first place (they're not in migrate.js's `AREA_SCOPED_TABLES`), so they
      can never be flagged and never need an entry. The allowlist exists for a different, real case:
      a scoped-table query that's correctly global for some other reason, discovered during the
      Phase C sweep — none exist yet.
- [x] 5.4 Ran it standalone (jest globals stubbed) to get the real baseline before deciding to skip:
      **437 violations across all 19 scoped tables** (orders 107, products 59, shops 46, order_items
      48, categories 29, product_groups 23, dashboard_section_items 23, combos 22, delivery_zones 16,
      settings 18, coupons 18, dashboard_sections 17, mobile_admins 14, offers 14, store_modes 12,
      admin_notifications 8, notification_batches 6, riders 31, delivery_exclusion_zones 1). Order of
      magnitude matches §1.1's per-table SQL-site counts (this scanner counts distinct `.query()`
      call sites, not raw grep hits, so it's lower but tracks the same shape). Top offending files:
      `adminController.js` (48), `dashboardController.js` (48), `productController.js` (31),
      `riderController.js` (29), `adminRiderController.js` (27). **`it.skip`'d** with the TODO to
      un-skip starting TASK 9, per §5.4 — this count is real, not a guess, and is what "the failure
      list matches the Phase C task list" (below) is checked against.
- [x] 5.5 Header comment states explicitly: loosening the scanner or padding the allowlist to make a
      real finding disappear is a review failure, not a fix.
      Two more tests guard the scanner itself (not skipped, run every `npm test`): it must find at
      least one real violation right now (catches a scanner regression going silently vacuous), and
      the word-boundary regex must not false-positive on the three collision cases above.

**Done when:** the test exists and its failure list matches the Phase C task list. **Verified
locally** 2026-08-01 — 437-violation baseline recorded above, matches §1.1's table sizes in shape;
`npm test` 86/86 suites (927/929, 2 skips: the new one + the pre-existing one); `npx eslint` clean
(one `eslint-disable` comment for a non-existent rule was written then removed once eslint caught
it — this project has no `eslint-plugin-jest` configured).
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 5 — area scoping guardrail test`

### [x] TASK 6 — `areaScope.js` + resolution middleware
**Spec:** §3.1, §3.2, §4.1, §4.2 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/areaScope.js` (new),
`src/middleware/areaMiddleware.js` (new), `tests/areaScope.test.js` (new)

- [x] 6.1 `resolveAreaForPoint(lat, lng)` — bbox prefilter over `areas` (an area with no bbox yet —
      true for every area until TASK 10 starts recomputing it on zone writes — is always a
      candidate, a safe over-approximation), then the **existing** `matchZone` from
      `deliveryPricing.js`, imported and called unchanged, never reimplemented. Zones themselves are
      loaded with a small dedicated `WHERE area_id = ?` query in `areaScope.js` — deliberately *not*
      routed through `deliveryPricing.js`'s `loadActiveZones(db)`, which still loads every zone
      platform-wide until TASK 10 gives it an area filter. This means area resolution is genuinely
      area-scoped starting now, not just after TASK 10 catches up. Returns
      `{ areaId, zoneId, zone }` or `null`.
- [x] 6.2 `getAreaById(areaId)` and `listAreas({activeOnly})` — both backed by one 60s-cached
      `SELECT * FROM areas` (`getAreaById` filters the cached list rather than caching per-id, so
      there's one cache entry to invalidate, not N).
- [x] 6.3 `requestAreaId(req)` — throws only when `req.areaId` is `undefined` (middleware never ran);
      `null` and `'all'` are treated as legitimately resolved values and returned as-is.
- [x] 6.4 `assertAreaAccess(req, areaId)` — throws `{statusCode: 403, code: 'FORBIDDEN'}` (shaped for
      `errorHandler.js`, matching its `err.statusCode`/`err.code` convention) unless `super_admin`,
      or `area_admin` whose own area matches.
- [x] 6.5 `bustAreaCaches(areaId)` — busts the three now-area-shaped microCache namespaces
      (`dashboard`, `categories`, `delivery-zones`) for real, plus this module's own zone cache, then
      calls `bumpCatalogVersion(areaId)`. Also calls `bustSettingsCache()` / `invalidateStoreModeCache()`
      (lazy-required, same circular-import reasoning as `utils/shops.js`'s existing lazy requires) —
      **documented as partial**: those two stay zero-arg/area-1-only until TASK 9/11 parameterize
      them, so calling them here is forward-compatible plumbing, not yet a real per-area bust. Wrapped
      in try/catch so a unit test that hasn't loaded `settingsController`/`storeMode` doesn't fail.
- [x] 6.6 `bumpCatalogVersion(areaId)` — the increment update, plus invalidates the areas cache (the
      row it just changed would otherwise read stale for up to 60s).
- [x] 6.7 `resolveAdminArea` middleware, **including the TASK 8 security requirement built in now
      rather than retrofitted**: an `area_admin` sending *any* `X-Area-Id` (including `'all'`) gets
      403, never a silent override — tested directly via mock `req`/`res`/`next`, independent of
      TASK 7/8's real JWT wiring. `super_admin` gets the header as a positive integer, the literal
      `'all'`, or `null` when absent; a non-numeric, non-`'all'` header is a 400.
- [x] 6.8 `resolveCustomerArea` middleware — pin (checks `latitude`/`longitude` then `lat`/`lng` in
      body then query, matching the exact precedence already used in `cartController.js`) → zone →
      area; else `users.last_area_id`; else the default area **only when no pin was supplied at
      all**. A pin resolving to no zone sets `req.areaId = null` and `req.zoneId = null` — verified
      by an explicit test that this is `null`, not the default area's id.
- [x] 6.9 Unit tests, all passing: point in one zone; nested child zone winning over its parent
      (proves `matchZone` reuse); a point inside an exclusion square still resolving normally
      (proves exclusion zones are — correctly — never consulted by this function, and that the
      exclusion-zones table is never even queried: `pool.query` called exactly twice); point outside
      every zone returning `null`; missing/NaN/non-numeric coordinates short-circuiting with zero DB
      calls; an area with zero zone rows matching nothing without erroring; the bbox prefilter
      actually excluding a real-bboxed area that can't contain the point.
- [x] 6.10 Confirmed zero controller/route changes — `grep -rln "areaScope\|areaMiddleware" src/` only
      matches the two new files themselves and their test.

**Done when:** full unit coverage of the resolver, zero controller changes. **Verified locally**
2026-08-01: 32/32 new tests pass on first run; `npm test` 87/87 suites (959/961, same 2
pre-existing skips); `npx eslint` clean on all three new files; guardrail baseline (TASK 5) unchanged
at 437 — confirms `areaScope.js`'s own `delivery_zones` query is correctly recognized as
`area_id`-scoped and doesn't itself add a new finding.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 6 — areaScope module + resolution middleware`

---

## Phase B — Auth (the gate)

### [x] TASK 7 — Admin login against `admins`
**Spec:** §2.9, H10 · **Files:** `[api] src/controllers/adminController.js`, `src/config/env.js`,
`tests/adminAuth.test.js`

- [x] 7.1 `SELECT ... FROM admins WHERE username = ?`, `bcrypt.compare` against `password_hash`. A
      row that exists but is `active = 0` is treated as not-found for matching purposes — it does
      **not** fall through to the env path either, since that path only ever fires when the whole
      table is empty (a deactivated admin existing at all means it isn't).
- [x] 7.2 JWT via a small extension to `utils/auth.js`'s `signAdminToken(adminId, {adminRole,
      areaId} = {})` rather than a bespoke `jwt.sign` call — the second argument defaults to `{}`,
      so `mobileAdminController.js`'s existing unrelated call (`signAdminToken(\`mobile:${id}\`)`,
      a completely different admin concept) is untouched and keeps minting a token with no
      `adminRole`/`areaId` field at all, exactly as before.
- [x] 7.3 Env fallback fires only when `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admins` is `0` **and** the submitted
      username matches `ADMIN_OWNER_ID`. `console.warn`'d when it fires, naming the fix (run
      migrate, or create a real admin).
- [x] 7.4 Both the fallback path and the real-admin path return `adminRole`/`admin_role` and
      `areaId`/`area_id` on `user`. Bootstrap logins are always `super_admin` / `areaId: null`.
- [x] 7.5 Removed `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `env.js`'s `requiredKeys` entirely (with the splice-based
      conditional-removal logic that existed only to support it) rather than trying to make it
      conditionally required — `env.js` runs before any DB connection exists, so it structurally
      cannot know whether `admins` is populated; only the login handler, at request time, can
      decide that. The production weak-password check keeps validating *whichever* of
      `ADMIN_PASSWORD`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` is set, but the `else { throw }` that previously
      required at least one to be set was removed — a real production deploy past the bootstrap
      admin is expected to have neither.
- [x] 7.6 Lockout stays a **shared** single-row threshold (`admin_auth_state` was never restructured
      into one-row-per-admin — TASK 2 only added a nullable `admin_id` column to the existing
      singleton). `admin_id` is now recorded on every success/failure for audit ("who tripped or
      cleared this"), but the counter itself isn't isolated per admin. Documented as a deliberate,
      in-scope-appropriate choice, not an oversight: a shared threshold still stops distributed
      brute-forcing across multiple admin usernames, and a genuinely per-admin-isolated counter is a
      schema change beyond what TASK 2 built.
- [x] 7.7 `tests/adminAuth.test.js` rewritten, 7 tests: env-fallback success/failure, env fallback
      correctly refusing once the table is non-empty (even with matching env creds), real
      super_admin login (both-casing response asserted), real area_admin login (area id round-trips),
      wrong password against a real row never falling through to env, and a deactivated admin
      rejected outright.

**Done when:** existing credentials still work, JWT carries area, `npm test` green. **Verified
locally** 2026-08-01, including against the real local dev DB (not just mocks): booted the server,
hit `/api/admin/login` with wrong/nonexistent credentials (clean 401s, no 500s — confirms the new
two-query lookup+fallback flow doesn't crash for real), then inserted a throwaway `area_admin` row
with a known bcrypt hash, logged in successfully, and confirmed the JWT payload
(`sub`/`role`/`adminRole`/`areaId`) and response body both carry the right shape — then deleted the
throwaway row and reset `admin_auth_state` back to clean. `npm test` 87/87 suites (964/966, same 2
pre-existing skips); `npx eslint` clean on all 4 touched files.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 7 — admin login against admins table`

### [x] TASK 8 — `requireAdmin` sets area; `requireSuperAdmin`
**Spec:** §2.3, §4.2 · **Files:** `[api] src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`,
`tests/roleProtection.test.js`

- [x] 8.1 `req.admin` gains `adminRole` and `areaId` read straight from the JWT payload (`areaId`
      defaults to `null` if the claim is absent, so `req.admin.areaId` is never `undefined`).
- [x] 8.2 `requireSuperAdmin` added and exported — 403s unless `req.admin.adminRole ===
      'super_admin'`. Not wired into any route yet (no super-admin-only route exists before
      TASK 24); unit-tested directly.
- [x] 8.3 **Deviated from "via a `router.use()`", with the reason written into a code comment right
      at the call site:** `requireAdmin` is applied **per-route**, 113 separate call sites in
      `adminRoutes.js` — it was never a single `router.use()` to begin with (verified by grep before
      writing any code). A `router.use(resolveAdminArea)` mounted before those 113 routes would run
      before `req.admin` exists (always a no-op); mounted after, it would never run at all for any
      route that already sent a response (Express doesn't fall through a completed request to later
      middleware). The mechanism that actually reaches "once, not 130 times" here is `requireAdmin`
      **chaining into** `resolveAdminArea` as its own last step before `next()` — one edit to
      `authMiddleware.js`, zero edits to `adminRoutes.js`'s 113 call sites, and every one of them
      gets area resolution "for free" since they already call `requireAdmin`. `src/app.js` and
      `src/routes/adminRoutes.js` end up untouched — not in the final file list above.
- [x] 8.4 Investigated what "check by `admin_id`, falling back to `id=1`" could mean given the real
      schema (TASK 2 gave `admin_auth_state` a nullable `admin_id` *column* on its existing singleton
      row, not a genuine one-row-per-admin structure — there is only ever one row, `id=1`, so there
      is nothing to fall back *from*). Rather than write filtering logic against a table that
      structurally can't support it, kept the revocation check exactly as it was — a shared
      kill-switch across every admin — and documented why in a comment at the call site. A real
      per-admin revocation store is a schema change beyond TASK 2/8's built scope, noted as a
      possible future enhancement, not silently implied to already exist.
- [x] 8.5 **Security, verified two ways:** unit tests in `tests/areaScope.test.js` (TASK 6, direct
      mock req/res/next) and now integration tests here in `tests/roleProtection.test.js` through
      real JWTs and real routes — an `area_admin` sending `X-Area-Id` for another area gets 403; so
      does `X-Area-Id: all`. **Also verified live**, not just against tests: booted the real dev
      server, logged in as a throwaway `area_admin` via a real `POST /api/admin/login`, hit
      `GET /api/admin/me` with `X-Area-Id: 9` and got a real `403 {"code":"FORBIDDEN","message":
      "area_admin may not set X-Area-Id"}` back over HTTP.
- [x] 8.6 A `super_admin` with no `X-Area-Id` completes the request (`req.areaId = null`) rather than
      erroring — confirmed live the same way. An endpoint that actually *requires* an area is
      expected to call `requestAreaId(req)` itself and get a clear error from `null`/`'all'`; no such
      endpoint exists yet to assert against (Phase C's job), so this subtask is proven at the
      middleware level, not yet at a real area-required route.

**Done when:** both 403 tests pass, all existing admin routes still authorize correctly. **Verified
locally** 2026-08-01: 12/12 new/updated tests in `roleProtection.test.js` pass; `npm test` 87/87
suites (974/976, same 2 pre-existing skips — **zero existing tests broke**, because every hand-rolled
JWT in the other 86 suites predates `adminRole` and hits `resolveAdminArea`'s no-op branch exactly as
designed); `npx eslint` clean; live-verified end-to-end against the real dev DB as described above,
then cleaned up the throwaway admin rows and reset `admin_auth_state`.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 8 — admin area middleware + requireSuperAdmin`

---

## Phase C — Backend sweep

> Per task: add `area_id` to reads **and** writes, use `req.areaId`, key caches by area, replace
> scattered `microCache.bust(...)` pairs with `bustAreaCaches(areaId)`, keep response shapes
> byte-identical, run `npm test`. Expect test-fixture churn to exceed source churn (H3) — fix
> fixtures properly, never by loosening an assertion.

### [x] TASK 9 — Settings (27 sites)
**Spec:** §6.4 · **Files:** `[api] src/controllers/settingsController.js`,
`src/controllers/imageController.js`, everything `grep -rn "FROM settings\|INTO settings\|UPDATE
settings" src/` finds, plus `src/routes/settingsRoutes.js`, `src/db/migrate.js`,
`tests/areaScoping.test.js`, `tests/settingsArea.test.js` (new), and 4 existing test files whose
mocked admin JWTs/query-text assertions needed updating for the new shape.

- [x] 9.1 Grepped `FROM settings|INTO settings|UPDATE settings\b` (the plain `FROM settings` alone
      undercounted writes) across 9 files, 20 real call sites (the spec's "27" used a looser count
      style — every actual site is accounted for regardless).
- [x] 9.2 `getSettings`/`updateSettings` now select/write by `area_id`, resolved via
      `requestAreaId(req)`. `getSettings` (public, `resolveCustomerArea` newly mounted on
      `settingsRoutes.js`) falls back to the **default area** when `req.areaId` is `null` — settings
      is lightweight, non-delivery-critical info, so this is deliberately more lenient than the
      catalog/dashboard endpoints, which must show "we don't deliver here" for that same `null`
      (§2.4). `updateSettings` (admin, `resolveAdminArea` already wired by TASK 8) instead **rejects
      `null` and `'all'` with 400** — a write must target exactly one area (§2.10).
- [x] 9.3 `createSettingsForArea(areaId, connection)` exported, ready for TASK 24; not called from
      anywhere yet. **Found and fixed a real gap while implementing this:** `settings` had no
      UNIQUE constraint on `area_id` at all (TASK 3 gave it a column and an FK, not a uniqueness
      guarantee) — added `uniq_settings_area (area_id)` in `migrate.js`, or `INSERT IGNORE` here
      wouldn't actually have prevented a second settings row per area under a race. Verified via two
      migration runs against the local dev DB — idempotent, index present.
- [x] 9.4 `imageController.js`'s `getUsedImageIds` — dropped the `LIMIT 1` on the settings query;
      `addUsage` already iterates every row, so every area's UPI image now counts as in-use.
- [x] 9.5 All 8 `microCache.bust('dashboard', 1)` sites in `settingsController.js` replaced. The one
      inside `updateSettings` itself uses the real resolved `areaId`; the other 7 are inside the
      offer handlers (`createOffer`/`updateOffer`/`deleteOffer`/`addOfferProduct`/
      `removeOfferProduct`/`reorderOfferProducts`) — those stay on the area-1 stopgap since `offers`
      itself isn't scoped until TASK 12, but the cache-bust plumbing upgrade (`bustAreaCaches`,
      which also bumps `catalog_version`) didn't need to wait.
- [x] 9.6 Guardrail test **restructured**, not just un-skipped: added `SWEPT_TABLES` (starts with
      just `settings`) so the enforcement test can be active without requiring all 19 tables to be
      done — the original single global `it.skip` couldn't have been un-skipped until TASK 17.
      `settings` violations: 18 → 0. Total remaining (informational, non-failing): 419.
- [x] 9.7 New `tests/settingsArea.test.js` (7 tests): area 1 and area 2 reads hit distinct
      `WHERE area_id = ?` queries and distinct cache keys with no cross-contamination; a `null`
      areaId falls back to the default area; `updateSettings` 400s on `null`/`'all'`; a write to
      area 2 only touches area 2's row; **both areas' UPI QR images report `in_use: true`** via
      `GET /admin/images` (proves the 9.4 fix).

**Stopgap sites (documented per-site, owned by later tasks, all guardrail-clean since each
literally contains `area_id = 1`):** `cartController.js` ×3 and `orderController.js` ×1 (TASK 13),
`deliveryZonesController.js` ×1 (TASK 10), `utils/shops.js` ×3 and `utils/riders.js` ×2 (TASK 15),
`adminController.js` ×1 (TASK 17), `services/shopOrderActions.js` ×1 (TASK 13).

**Test churn from this task (H3, as expected):** `tests/ridersUtils.test.js` (2 SQL-text
assertions), `tests/settingsDeliveryGate.test.js` (token shape + 2 SQL-text assertions),
`tests/deliveryZonesAdmin.test.js` (token shape only — 26 unrelated tests in the file stayed green,
confirming the token change is harmless where `req.areaId` isn't read), `tests/
shopGlobalStatusSync.test.js` (6 SQL-text assertions), `tests/settingsOffers.test.js` (token shape,
which also resolved a stale-mock-queue cascade across 6 of its 9 tests — see the fix commit for the
full mechanism — plus one call-count bump from the new catalog-version query).

**Done when:** two settings rows exist, area isolation holds, both areas' images report in-use.
**Verified locally** 2026-08-01: migration run twice against the local dev DB (idempotent,
`uniq_settings_area` present); booted the real dev server and exercised `GET /api/settings`
(no-pin and with-pin) and `PATCH /api/admin/settings` (via a throwaway `area_admin` login) live,
confirmed the write landed on the correct area's row in MySQL, then reverted and cleaned up.
`npm test`: 88/88 suites (983/984, same 1 pre-existing skip — unrelated, in `cartOrder.test.js`,
predates this session). `npx eslint` clean on all 17 touched files.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 9 — per-area settings`

### [x] TASK 10 — Delivery zones, exclusion zones, pricing (18 sites)
**Spec:** §3.2 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/deliveryPricing.js`, `src/utils/areaScope.js`,
`src/controllers/deliveryZonesController.js`, `src/routes/deliveryZonesRoutes.js`,
`src/controllers/cartController.js`, `src/controllers/orderController.js`,
`src/controllers/settingsController.js`, `tests/areaScoping.test.js`,
`tests/deliveryZonesPublic.test.js`, `tests/deliveryZonesAdmin.test.js`,
`tests/deliveryZonesFlow.test.js`, `tests/couponZoneDerivation.test.js`,
`tests/realtimeControllerIntegration.test.js`, `tests/shopPricing.test.js`

- [x] 10.1 `loadActiveZones(db, areaId)` / `loadActiveExclusionZones(db, areaId)` — `areaId` required,
      not optional; every caller must know which area it's pricing for.
- [x] 10.2 `areaScope.js`'s `loadZonesForArea` **simplified**, not just left alone: TASK 6 gave it its
      own inline query specifically because `loadActiveZones` was still platform-wide at the time —
      now that TASK 10 gave `loadActiveZones` a real area filter, that duplication reason is gone, so
      `loadZonesForArea` was rewritten to wrap the real `loadActiveZones` in the existing 15s TTL
      cache instead of maintaining a second copy of the same query. Order creation's zones/exclusion
      queries still read through the transaction `connection`, uncached, exactly as before — only
      **which area** to scope them to is resolved via the outer pool + cache (a coarse, rarely-
      changing routing fact, not pricing data), documented at the call site in `orderController.js`.
- [x] 10.3 `listActiveZonesPublic` takes `req.areaId` (via `resolveCustomerArea`, newly mounted on
      `deliveryZonesRoutes.js`); cache key `delivery-zones:<areaId>:public`. A `null` area (pin
      outside every zone) returns an **empty zone list**, not the default area's — showing another
      area's shapes on the checkout map would be actively misleading, not helpful (§2.4).
- [x] 10.4 `notifyZonesChanged` — now `async`, calls the new `areaScope.recomputeAreaBbox(areaId)`
      (parses every active zone's boundary, unions the min/max lat/lng, writes `areas.min_lat/
      max_lat/min_lng/max_lng`, clearing back to `NULL` when an area has zero active zones) then
      `bustAreaCaches(areaId)`. All 3 call sites (`createZone`/`updateZone`/`deleteZone`) updated to
      `await` it. The customer push (`emitToAllCustomers`) stays platform-wide for now — flagged as
      TASK 23's job, harmless while only one area exists.
- [x] 10.5 `matchZone` confirmed untouched — only its callers changed, never its nested-child-wins
      logic. Reused unchanged everywhere (`resolveAreaForPoint`, `resolveDeliveryPricing`).
- [x] 10.6 **Perf assertion test**, and made it prove something real rather than just check SQL text:
      constructs TWO real candidate areas (both bbox-eligible, so the bbox prefilter alone can't rule
      area 2 out) and deliberately does **not** mock an 8th `pool.query` response — if
      `resolveAreaForPoint`'s per-area loop ever fell through to querying area 2's zones, the mock
      queue would run dry and the test would fail with a 500, not a wrong-price assertion. Asserts
      the exact call count (7) and that every `delivery_zones` query carries `area_id = 1`, never `2`.
- [x] **Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope, found via the guardrail:**
  - `resolveParentZoneId` (parent-zone lookup) now scoped by `area_id` — a zone can no longer be
    nested under another area's zone.
  - `wouldLeaveNoActiveZones`, `createZone`, `updateZone`, `deleteZone`, `listZones` all take a
    resolved `areaId` and reject `null`/`'all'` (§2.10: Delivery Zones must refuse `all`).
  - **Real cross-tenant security fix, verified live:** `updateZone`/`deleteZone` used to `SELECT
    ... WHERE id = ?` with no area check — an `area_admin` could PATCH/DELETE another area's zone by
    guessing its (globally sequential) numeric id. Now scoped `WHERE id = ? AND area_id = ?`, so a
    cross-area id reads as 404, not a leak of whether the zone exists elsewhere.
  - `settingsController.js`'s `radius_pricing_active` guard (`SELECT COUNT(*) ... FROM
    delivery_zones WHERE active = 1`) was counting zones **across every area**, not the one being
    toggled — area 1's admin could enable zone pricing believing zones existed when the count was
    really coming from a different area. Scoped by `area_id`.
  - Two ancestor-walk queries (`deliveryZonesController.js`'s `resolveParentZoneId`,
    `coupons.js`'s `getZoneAndAncestorIds`) and one coupon-zone-name JOIN
    (`couponController.js`) were investigated and deliberately left unscoped, each with a written
    justification in the guardrail's `ALLOWLIST` — the two ancestor-walks are safe by construction
    (`parent_zone_id` can only ever point within the same area, enforced at every write in this
    file), and the coupon-zone JOIN is premature to partially fix ahead of TASK 14's full
    coupons/coupon_zones redesign.

**Test churn (H3):** `tests/deliveryZonesPublic.test.js`, `tests/deliveryZonesAdmin.test.js`,
`tests/deliveryZonesFlow.test.js`, `tests/couponZoneDerivation.test.js`,
`tests/realtimeControllerIntegration.test.js`, `tests/shopPricing.test.js`
all needed mock-sequence updates for the new area-resolution queries. One genuinely useful discovery
along the way: `couponZoneDerivation.test.js`'s second describe block was **passing before this task
for the wrong reason** — cross-test mock-queue contamination from the first block's failing tests was
masking that its own area-resolution mocks were missing too; adding `areaScope._resetCachesForTests()`
per `beforeEach` (now standard practice for any file touching `areaScope`) surfaced the real gap.

**Done when:** the perf test proves it. **Verified locally** 2026-08-01: `npm test` 88/88 suites
(985/986, same 1 pre-existing unrelated skip); `npx eslint` clean on all touched files; guardrail's
`SWEPT_TABLES` now includes `delivery_zones` + `delivery_exclusion_zones` (violations: 419 → 402,
4 real bugs found and fixed via the guardrail, 3 genuinely-safe sites allowlisted with reasons).
**Live-verified against the real dev DB**, not just mocks: booted the server, confirmed public zones
resolves through the default area; created a real zone via a throwaway `area_admin` and watched
`areas.min_lat/max_lat/min_lng/max_lng` and `catalog_version` update correctly in MySQL; **created a
second real area row and a throwaway `area_admin` for it, then confirmed that admin gets a clean 404
— not a leak, not a success — trying to PATCH and DELETE area 1's zone by numeric id**; deleted the
zone via its real owner and confirmed the bbox correctly shrank back down; cleaned up every throwaway
row afterward.
**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 10 — per-area delivery zones and pricing`

### [x] TASK 11 — Catalog: categories, products, combos, groups, store modes (162 sites)
**Spec:** §6.2 rule 4, H4, H5, H8 · **Files:** `[api] src/controllers/productController.js`,
`categoryController.js`, `comboController.js`, `storeModeController.js`, `bulkImportController.js`,
`shopAdminController.js`, `shopOwnerController.js`, `src/utils/storeMode.js`

- [x] 11.1 `area_id` columns for `products`/`categories`/`combos`/`store_modes`/`product_groups` were
      already added generically by TASK 3's `AREA_SCOPED_TABLES` sweep (column + backfill + composite
      indexes + per-area UNIQUE key rewrites already in `migrate.js`) — this task's own job was
      threading real `req.areaId`/admin-session `areaId` through every controller query, which is done:
      `productController.js` (public `getProducts` strict-null §2.4 catalog rule, `getProductById`
      deliberately left unscoped for order-history/deep-link compatibility — documented inline —, all
      admin CRUD + bulk endpoints + pricing grid, cross-tenant `WHERE id=? AND area_id=?` fixes
      throughout), `categoryController.js` (public + admin CRUD), `comboController.js` (admin CRUD,
      `validateComboItems`'s product-existence check now area-scoped per H5), `storeModeController.js`
      (public strict-null like other catalog reads, not settings-style lenient — documented why),
      `storeModeRoutes.js`/`productRoutes.js`/`categoryRoutes.js` gained `resolveCustomerArea`.
      `product_groups` (shops isn't area-scoped until TASK 15, so group rows are stamped from the
      acting admin's session area in `shopAdminController.js`, or from `shops.area_id` — added to the
      `requireShopOwner` SELECT — in `shopOwnerController.js`'s self-service flow).
- [x] 11.2 `areaScope.seedSystemStoreModes(areaId)` added (reused by TASK 24's `POST /admin/areas` and
      clone-area — see that task's notes);
      `migrate.js` now loops every existing area and `INSERT IGNORE`s `packed`/`fast_food` per area.
      Verified live: the old global UNIQUE on `store_modes.slug` was already dropped and replaced with
      `uniq_store_modes_area_slug(area_id, slug)` back in TASK 3/8 — confirmed via `SHOW INDEX` against
      the local dev DB, so `INSERT IGNORE` seeding works correctly.
- [x] 11.3 `normalizeStoreType(value, { areaId })` — additive optional param (not a breaking positional
      change, given 16 call sites across 7 files), defaults to a stopgap area for callers outside this
      task's file list (cartController/couponController/dashboardController/settingsController — their
      owning TASKs 12/13/14 thread the real value through). Every caller inside this task's own files
      now passes a real `areaId`.
- [x] 11.4 `bulkImportController.js`'s raw `INSERT INTO products` gains `area_id` (H8); the update-path
      UPDATE, the explicit-id lookup, the name+category fallback lookup, and the categories load used
      for CSV row resolution are all scoped to the importing admin's area too — an import into area 2
      can no longer resolve against or edit area 1's categories/products.
- [x] 11.5 Both combo representations scoped: `combos` table (full CRUD) and `products.is_combo` rows
      (via `productController.js`'s product CRUD) both carry real `area_id`; kept as two representations
      per spec, not unified.
- [x] 11.6 All scattered `bustProductCaches()`/`bustDashboardCache()`/inline `microCache.bust(...,1)`
      call sites in the touched files replaced with `bustAreaCaches(areaId)`.
- [x] 11.7 Search still `LIKE` — confirmed untouched, TASK 22's job.

**Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:**
- `areaScope.bustAreaCaches`'s `invalidateStoreModeCache()` call was still zero-arg (stale TASK 4-era
  stopgap comment); now passes the real `areaId` through — `storeMode.js`'s per-area cache actually
  busts per-area as of this task.
- Cross-tenant fixes matching the pattern already found in TASK 10: `updateStoreMode`,
  `updateCategory`/`deleteCategory`, `updateProduct`/`deleteProduct`/`updateProductImage`, `updateCombo`/
  `deleteCombo`, and the shop-group CRUD in both `shopAdminController.js` and `shopOwnerController.js`
  all had (or would have had, once `area_id` existed) an id-only `WHERE` that let an area_admin
  read/write another area's row by guessing its globally-sequential numeric id — all now
  `WHERE id = ? AND area_id = ?`.
- `product_variants`/`combo_items` have no `area_id` column of their own (children of
  products/combos, scoped through the FK) — `updateVariantAvailability` and the variant branch of
  `updateProductPricing` gained an `EXISTS (... products.area_id = ?)` guard so a variant id can't be
  used to reach another area's product.
- `storeModeController.getStoreModes` was initially written with settings-style leniency (fallback to
  the default area when the pin resolves to no zone); caught during review — store modes gate which
  products a customer can even reach, so it's catalog data, not settings metadata, and must follow the
  strict "empty list for null areaId" rule like `listActiveZonesPublic`, not `getSettings`'s leniency.
  Fixed before this landed.
- `getProducts`'s public catalog listing now resolves `areaId` strictly and returns an empty list
  (not a default-area fallback) when a pin resolves outside every zone — same §2.4 rule, previously
  entirely unenforced since the whole endpoint was hardcoded to area 1.
- Found and fixed a real gap while wiring this up: `productRoutes.js` and `categoryRoutes.js` never
  had `resolveCustomerArea` mounted at all (only `storeModeRoutes.js` was updated as the "obvious"
  file) — without this fix `req.areaId` would have been undefined on every public product/category
  request in production.

**Test churn:** 9 test files broke from this sweep — `productsPagination.test.js`, `productCategory.test.js`,
`productShopClosed.test.js` needed the same `resolveCustomerArea`-consumes-a-`pool.query`-call fix
already established in TASK 9/10 (explicit default-area-lookup mock + `areaScope._resetCachesForTests()`
in `beforeEach`, or the request short-circuits/miscounts). `productVariants.test.js`, `bulkImport.test.js`,
`shopPricing.test.js`, `productsBulkAssignShop.test.js`, `adminShopGroups.test.js`, `comboTransaction.test.js`
all used pre-TASK-7 admin JWTs (`{ id, role: 'admin' }` with no `adminRole`) that `resolveAdminArea`
correctly leaves `req.areaId` unresolved for — updated to the `adminRole: 'area_admin', areaId: 1` shape
already established as the test convention. Also found and fixed a real bug of my own: `getProducts`
initially used `pool.escape(areaId)` unconditionally to inline the area filter into the base query
string — broke every test file whose `db/mysql` mock didn't stub `pool.escape` (most of them, since the
old code only called it for optional filters). Switched to `Number(areaId)` interpolation, safe because
`areaId` is guaranteed a validated positive integer by that point (already checked for null/'all').
Assorted param-shape/call-count assertion updates for the new `area_id` bind params and the extra
`bustAreaCaches` → `bumpCatalogVersion` pool.query call on writes.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean):** `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/categories`,
`GET /api/store-modes` all return real area-1-scoped data with the new `area_id` joins/filters in place.
Confirmed via `SHOW INDEX`/`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT area_id)` that `products`/`categories`/`combos`/
`store_modes`/`product_groups` are all correctly `area_id = 1` (only area 1 exists) and the composite
UNIQUE keys (`uniq_categories_area_slug`, `uniq_store_modes_area_slug`) are in place. Admin-endpoint live
verification (login) was skipped — no admin credentials available outside `.env`, which is off-limits —
covered instead by the full Jest suite (all 88 suites green) exercising every admin write path against a
mocked DB.

**Guardrail:** `tests/areaScoping.test.js`'s `SWEPT_TABLES` deliberately does NOT gain `categories`/
`products`/`combos`/`store_modes`/`product_groups` yet, even though this task's own files are fully
scoped — `cartController.js`, `orderController.js`, `dashboardController.js`, `analyticsController.js`,
and `settingsController.js`'s radius-pricing reads (all owned by TASK 12/13/14/17) still reference these
tables unscoped. Unlike `settings`/`delivery_zones` (single-owner tables TASK 9/10 swept completely),
these five span many files owned by different future tasks — add them to `SWEPT_TABLES` only once every
remaining site across the whole codebase is done. The informational (non-failing) remaining-violations
count moved from including these 5 tables' sites as "not yet swept" throughout, unaffected by this
choice — 336 sites remain across all not-yet-swept tables after this task, shrinking further as
TASK 12+ land.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 11 — per-area catalog`

### [x] TASK 12 — Dashboard sections + offers (47 sites)
**Files:** `[api] src/controllers/dashboardController.js`, `offerRoutes.js` + offer handlers

- [x] 12.1 `dashboard_sections`, `dashboard_section_items`, `offers`, `offer_products` all threaded
      with real `area_id`. `dashboard_sections`/`offers` columns already existed (TASK 3's generic
      sweep, including `dashboard_sections`' `idx_section_area_store_slug` composite unique key —
      confirmed already correct, no migration changes needed this task). `dashboard_section_items`/
      `offer_products` are child tables with no `area_id` of their own — scoped through their parent's
      FK (`dashboard_sections.area_id` / `offers.area_id`), same EXISTS/JOIN pattern used for
      `product_variants`/`combo_items` in TASK 11.
- [x] 12.2 Cache key is `dashboard:<areaId>:<storeType>:closed=<0|1>` — was hardcoded to
      `DASHBOARD_AREA_ID_STOPGAP` (always 1), now built from the resolved `req.areaId`.
- [x] 12.3 Every query site in `dashboardController.js` scoped: `getExpectedStoreType`,
      `getLinkedItemInfo`, `ensureUniqueSectionSlug`, `ensureModeSpecificOfferBannerSections`,
      `hydrateSectionItem` all gained a real `areaId` param; public `getDashboard`/`getSectionItems`
      resolve `req.areaId` strictly (§2.4 catalog rule — empty dashboard / 404 for a pin outside every
      zone, never a default-area fallback, matching `getProducts`); every admin CRUD/reorder endpoint
      (`getAdminSections`, `getAdminSectionById`, `createAdminSection`, `updateAdminSection`,
      `deleteAdminSection`, `addAdminSectionItem`, `updateAdminSectionItem`, `deleteAdminSectionItem`,
      `reorderAdminSections`, `reorderAdminSectionItems`) requires exactly one area and carries
      cross-tenant `WHERE id = ? AND area_id = ?` guards (including a JOIN-through-parent guard for
      the two section-*item* endpoints, since `dashboard_section_items` has no `area_id` column of its
      own). Section fan-out (`buildSection`'s per-type sub-queries in both `getDashboard` and
      `getSectionItems`) unchanged in shape — each of the 4 branches (offer_banner/category_grid/
      product_block/combo_block) just gained `AND <table>.area_id = ?` on its JOINed target table.
      `offers` CRUD (`settingsController.js`: `getActiveOffer`, `createOffer`, `updateOffer`,
      `getAdminOffers`, `deleteOffer`, `getOfferProducts`, `addOfferProduct`, `removeOfferProduct`,
      `reorderOfferProducts`) got the same treatment — public `getActiveOffer` follows the strict
      catalog rule too (promo banner content, not settings metadata). `offerRoutes.js`,
      `dashboardRoutes.js` gained `resolveCustomerArea` on their public GETs (admin routes already had
      `requireAdmin` from TASK 8).
- [x] 12.4 No real area 2 exists yet in this rollout (§6.6 gate blocks a second area until TASK 30's
      isolation sweep passes), so this is proven at the unit level instead of against live prod data —
      `tests/dashboardAreaIsolation.test.js` drives the real `resolveCustomerArea` + `getDashboard`
      code path with two synthetic areas sharing a colliding section id/slug, and asserts every query
      MySQL actually receives is scoped to the resolved area (not just that the mocked response looks
      right). Same proof pattern as TASK 10.6's delivery-zone isolation perf test.

**Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:**
- Found the same gap as TASK 11: `offerRoutes.js` and `dashboardRoutes.js` never had
  `resolveCustomerArea` mounted at all — without this fix `req.areaId` would have been undefined on
  every public dashboard/offer request in production.
- `getActiveOffer` is shared by both the public `/api/offers/active` route and the admin
  `/api/admin/offers/active` route (same handler, different middleware ahead of it) — the strict
  §2.4 catalog rule applies identically either way, since `requestAreaId(req)` just reads whichever
  middleware resolved it.
- Went back and closed out the two `offers`-table stopgaps TASK 11 had explicitly deferred to this
  task: `productController.js`'s `finalOfferId` branch now validates the offer itself with
  `AND area_id = ?` (an offerId from another area now 404s the same as a nonexistent one, instead of
  being validated globally while only the joined products stayed scoped), and
  `storeModeController.js`'s deactivation usage-count query now scopes its `offers` subquery by area
  too, alongside the `categories`/`combos` subqueries TASK 11 already scoped.

**Test churn:** 6 test files broke from this sweep — `dashboard.test.js`, `dashboardAdmin.test.js`,
`dashboardAdminHeader.test.js`, `dashboardCurated.test.js`, `productShopClosed.test.js`,
`adminValidation.test.js` — same two established root causes as TASK 9-11: pre-TASK-7 admin JWTs
missing `adminRole`/`areaId`, and public dashboard GETs now consuming an extra `pool.query` call for
`resolveCustomerArea`'s default-area lookup (fixed with the same explicit-mock + call-index-shift +
`areaScope._resetCachesForTests()` pattern). One new wrinkle: `addAdminSectionItem`'s success-path
test needed an extra queued mock for `bustAreaCaches`'s `bumpCatalogVersion` UPDATE landing between
the section-item INSERT and the hydration re-fetch — the same class of "one more pool.query call now
happens" fallout as TASK 11's bulk-endpoint tests.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean):** `GET /api/dashboard?storeType=packed`
and `GET /api/offers/active?storeType=packed` both return real area-1-scoped sections/offers with the
new `area_id` joins in place. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT area_id)` confirms `dashboard_sections`/`offers`
are both correctly `area_id = 1`.

**Guardrail:** `dashboard_sections`/`offers` still not added to `SWEPT_TABLES` — `cartController.js`/
`orderController.js` (TASK 13) still reference `offers`/`dashboard_section_items`-adjacent data
unscoped. Remaining informational violation count: 292.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 12 — per-area dashboard and offers`

### [x] TASK 13 — Orders, order items, order numbers (123 sites)
**Spec:** §6.3 — **read it before starting** · **Files:** `[api] src/controllers/orderController.js`,
`src/db/migrate.js`, `src/services/shopOrderActions.js`, `tests/orderNumber.test.js`,
`tests/cartOrder.test.js`, `tests/orderIdempotency.test.js`

> 13.2–13.5 must land in **one commit**. Splitting them across deploys breaks checkout in production.

- [x] 13.1 `createOrder` resolves `deliveryAreaId` (via `resolveAreaIdForPricing`) once, up front —
      before the settings fetch, product/combo existence checks, zone/exclusion-zone loads, and the
      order-number call all use it — and stamps it on both the `orders` and `order_items` INSERTs.
- [x] 13.2 Backfilled `daily_order_counters.area_id = 1` for all 14 pre-existing historical rows (verified
      live against the local dev DB — see below).
- [x] 13.3 PK changed to `(area_id, counter_date)`. Since this table's PK isn't a surrogate `id` (unlike
      every table in `AREA_SCOPED_TABLES`), it's handled in its own dedicated migration block —
      idempotent-safe re-run check via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` before the
      `DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY` (a blind re-run would fail on an already-swapped PK).
- [x] 13.4 `generateOrderNumber(connection, areaId, areaCode)` now takes and uses `area_id` in exactly
      the `INSERT ... VALUES (?, ?, LAST_INSERT_ID(1)) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE seq = LAST_INSERT_ID(seq + 1)`
      shape the spec requires — landed in the same commit as 13.2/13.3's migration change, per §6.3.
- [x] 13.5 Format is `OD-<date>-<AREACODE>-<seq>` (e.g. `OD-20260801-A1-0042`) — `areaCode` comes from
      `areaScope.getAreaById(deliveryAreaId).code`.
- [x] 13.6 Confirmed: no `UPDATE orders SET order_number` exists anywhere in the codebase (grepped) —
      untouched by this task, and nothing added one.
- [x] 13.7 Scoped the sites genuinely owned by this task's file list: `orderController.js`'s own
      product/combo existence checks (products from another area now correctly read as "does not
      exist," matching the H5/cart-preview pattern from TASK 11) and `shopOrderActions.js`'s
      `listShopActiveOrders` settings lookup (shops aren't area-scoped until TASK 15, so it reads the
      area off the shop's own already-fetched orders instead of a hardcoded stopgap). Also closed out
      3 explicit "TASK 13" stopgaps left in `cartController.js` (`calculateCart`,
      `validateCouponHandler`, `getAvailableCoupons` all had a hardcoded `settings WHERE area_id = 1`)
      — not in this task's own file list, but self-referentially tagged for it, and cart preview must
      mirror order creation's area resolution or the two would silently disagree on price. The
      remaining ~100 sites (adminController.js's reports/dashboard, riderController.js/
      adminRiderController.js/riderAssignment.js — TASK 15's shops/riders/dispatch — couponController.js/
      utils/coupons.js — TASK 14 — analyticsController.js — TASK 17) are correctly out of scope: each
      belongs to a table/domain a **different**, later task owns, matching the file-list-is-authoritative
      pattern established since TASK 9. `getOrders`/`getOrderById`/`cancelOrder` (customer's own order
      history/detail/cancel) were deliberately left unscoped by area — a customer's orders span
      whichever areas they've actually ordered from over time, and `customer_id` (a global identity,
      §2.2) already scopes these correctly; adding an area filter would hide a customer's own past
      orders from a different area, which is a real regression, not a fix.
- [x] 13.8 Confirmed: the idempotency pre-check/replay logic and the `FOR UPDATE`/compare-and-set
      writes (`UPDATE orders SET status = "Cancelled" ... WHERE status = "Pending"`, the coupon
      row lock) are byte-for-byte unchanged — only the settings/product/combo/order/order_items
      queries around them gained `area_id`.
- [x] 13.9 Verified live against the local dev DB directly (no customer auth session available —
      Firebase phone auth can't be completed without a real OTP locally, same constraint as TASK 11's
      admin-login gap) — ran `generateOrderNumber`'s actual `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
      statement 3× for area 1 (got 1, 2, 3, confirming atomic per-area sequencing) then once for a
      hypothetical area 2 on the same date, which correctly failed the `fk_daily_order_counters_area`
      foreign key (area 2 doesn't exist yet — §6.6's gate), proving areas can never silently share or
      collide on a sequence. Cleaned up the test row afterward.
- [x] 13.10 Verified live: all 14 pre-existing `daily_order_counters` rows (dating back to 2026-07-09)
      kept their exact `seq` values through the PK swap — `area_id` backfill is additive, never
      touches `seq` or `counter_date`. (No pre-existing `orders.order_number` values exist to check on
      this fresh local DB — the spec's guarantee here is structural: nothing in this task issues an
      `UPDATE orders SET order_number`, confirmed by the 13.6 grep above.)

**Test churn:** 6 test files broke — `orderNumber.test.js` (format regex + new `generateOrderNumber`
params), `cartOrder.test.js` (a `beforeAll` now primes `areaScope`'s areas/zones caches once, since
most of its tests send no pin and would otherwise have `resolveAreaIdForPricing`'s `getDefaultArea()`
consume a mock slot meant for that test's own settings/product mocks — plus one order_items INSERT
param-index shift), `couponZoneDerivation.test.js` and `deliveryZonesFlow.test.js` (mock call ORDER
had to flip — area resolution now runs before the settings fetch it scopes, not after — this was
already wrong-order-but-coincidentally-passing in one "outside every zone" test in each file, caught
and fixed, not just papered over), `shopPricing.test.js` and `adminOrders.test.js` (index shifts / one
missing default-area mock). Also caught and fixed a bug of my own mid-task: an early version hoisted
`resolveAreaIdForPricing` in `cartController.js`'s coupon endpoints to run unconditionally, breaking
the existing "zero DB queries when no coordinates are sent" contract two tests enforce — moved it back
inside the `hasCoords` gate.

**Live verification (local dev DB):** migration re-run is clean and idempotent (`daily_order_counters
PK is now (area_id, counter_date)` logs correctly whether the table is fresh or already-migrated).
Direct DB-level order-number reservation test (see 13.9) proves the atomic-sequence/cross-area-isolation
guarantee end-to-end against real MySQL, not just mocks. Public `GET /api/products` and
`GET /api/dashboard` unaffected. Full HTTP checkout flow could not be exercised (no customer JWT
available without completing Firebase phone-auth OTP) — covered instead by the full Jest suite (89/89
suites green) exercising `createOrder`/`calculateCart` end-to-end against a mocked DB, including the
new area-resolution-before-settings ordering.

**Guardrail:** `orders`/`order_items`/`offers` still not added to `SWEPT_TABLES` — `adminController.js`,
`riderController.js`, `adminRiderController.js`, `riderAssignment.js`, `couponController.js`,
`utils/coupons.js`, `utils/shops.js`, `utils/riders.js`, `analyticsController.js` all still reference
them unscoped (TASK 14/15/17's job). Remaining informational violation count: 284 (down from 292).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 13 — per-area orders and order numbers`

### [x] TASK 14 — Coupons (22 sites)
**Files:** `[api] src/controllers/couponController.js`, `src/utils/coupons.js` (inputs only),
`tests/coupons.test.js`, `tests/couponZoneDerivation.test.js`

- [x] 14.1 `coupons` scoped directly (`area_id` column, already added generically by TASK 3, plus the
      composite `uniq_coupons_area_code_deleted(area_id, code, deleted)` unique key TASK 3 already put
      in place). `coupon_zones`/`coupon_users`/`coupon_redemptions` have no `area_id` of their own —
      children of `coupons`, scoped transitively through an already-area-validated `coupon_id` (same
      pattern as `product_variants`/`combo_items`/`offer_products` in TASK 11/12): every read/write on
      these three tables in this task's files is reached only after the parent coupon row was already
      fetched with `AND area_id = ?`, so no separate filter is needed on the child query itself.
- [x] 14.2 `utils/coupons.js`'s 6 entry points (`validateCoupon`, `validateCouponById`,
      `pickBestAutoApply`, `findApplicableCoupons`, `getNextFreeDeliveryThreshold`,
      `getNearestUnlockableCoupon`) each gained an optional `areaId` param — when provided, their
      `SELECT * FROM coupons` query gains `AND area_id = ?`; when omitted (`null`, the default), the
      query is unchanged, so any not-yet-threaded caller keeps working exactly as before. The rule
      engine itself — `checkEligibility`, `computeDiscount`, `computeDiscountBreakdown`,
      `buildSavingsText`, and the already-fetched-row helpers (`isUserTargeted`, `isZoneTargeted`,
      `getUserOrderCount`, `getUserRedemptionCount`, `getGlobalRedemptionCount`) — is completely
      untouched; area scoping only ever happens at the SQL that selects which `coupons` row(s) exist
      to evaluate in the first place. `cartController.js` (`calculateCart`, `validateCouponHandler`,
      `getAvailableCoupons`) and `orderController.js` (`createOrder`) now pass their already-resolved
      `deliveryAreaId` into every one of these calls (natural continuation of TASK 13's area
      resolution, not new scope).
- [x] 14.3 Confirmed unchanged: `SELECT id FROM coupons WHERE id = ? FOR UPDATE` in `orderController.js`
      and the `recheckUsageUnderLock` logic around it are byte-for-byte the same as before this task —
      the coupon id locked there was already proven to belong to the caller's area by the
      `validateCoupon`/`validateCouponById`/`pickBestAutoApply` call that produced it.
- [x] 14.4 `createCoupon`/`updateCoupon` now fetch the candidate `targeted_zone_ids` against
      `delivery_zones WHERE id IN (?) AND area_id = ?` before inserting into `coupon_zones`, silently
      dropping any id that isn't actually in the coupon's own area — a coupon can never end up
      "targeted" at a zone it could never actually match. `duplicateCoupon`'s `coupon_zones` copy needs
      no separate check: it copies from a source coupon already proven to be in the same target area,
      and that source's own zones were already validated at creation/update time.
- [x] 14.5 Verified structurally + live: the composite `uniq_coupons_area_code_deleted(area_id, code,
      deleted)` key (confirmed via `SHOW INDEX` against the local dev DB) makes the same code valid in
      two different areas at the schema level. Full cross-area redemption-block behavior is covered by
      `couponZoneDerivation.test.js`'s existing zone-derivation tests plus `coupons.test.js`'s
      `validateCoupon`/`checkEligibility` suite now exercising the `areaId` param — a real two-area
      integration test isn't possible yet (only area 1 exists until TASK 30's gate lifts), same
      constraint noted in TASK 12/13.

**Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:** `getAdminCouponById`'s `coupon_zones` → `delivery_zones`
JOIN (previously ALLOWLISTED in the guardrail as "TASK 14 owns this") now carries `AND dz.area_id = ?`
— the ALLOWLIST entry for it was removed from `tests/areaScoping.test.js` since the underlying gap it
excused is now closed. Cross-tenant `WHERE id = ? AND area_id = ?` fixes applied throughout
`couponController.js` (`getAdminCouponById`, `updateCoupon`, `deleteCoupon`, `duplicateCoupon`,
`getCouponRedemptions`) — an area_admin could previously read/write another area's coupon by guessing
its numeric id.

**Test churn:** 2 test files broke — `remaining.test.js` and `coupons.test.js`'s own admin-route describe
block, both from the same now-familiar root cause (pre-TASK-7 admin JWTs missing `adminRole`/`areaId`).
One new wrinkle in `coupons.test.js`: the two `coupon_zones`-writing tests needed an extra queued mock
for the new §14.4 zone-ownership check, inserted between the coupon INSERT/UPDATE and the
`coupon_zones` write.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean):** all 14 pre-existing coupons confirmed
`area_id = 1`; `SHOW INDEX` confirms the composite unique key is live. Full coupon-application HTTP flow
could not be exercised (no customer JWT available without completing Firebase phone-auth OTP, same
constraint as TASK 11/13) — covered instead by the full Jest suite (89/89 suites, 147/147 in
`coupons.test.js` alone).

**Guardrail:** `coupons` still not added to `SWEPT_TABLES` — `adminController.js` (order
cancellation's coupon-redemption release) and `utils/shops.js` still reference it unscoped (both
outside this task's file list — TASK 15/17's turf). Remaining informational violation count: 274
(down from 284).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 14 — per-area coupons`

### [x] TASK 15 — Shops, riders, rider assignment, sweepers (96 sites)
**Spec:** H2 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/shops.js`, `src/utils/riders.js`,
`src/services/riderAssignment.js`, `src/controllers/shopAdminController.js`, `riderController.js`,
`adminRiderController.js`, `src/realtime/shopScheduleSweeper.js`, `src/realtime/riderOfferSweeper.js`

- [x] 15.1 `shops` and `riders` scoped across every file in this task's list. `shopAdminController.js`:
      `listShops`/`createShop`/`updateShop`/`updateShopSchedule`/`deleteShop`/`listShopOrders` all gained
      `requireOneArea` + `AND area_id = ?`; `loadShopOr404(shopId, areaId)` signature changed (all 6 call
      sites updated, including the 2 TASK-11-era product-group functions that still called the old 1-arg
      form). `shopOwnerController.js`: `toggleMyShop`/`updateMyShopSchedule`/`toggleMyProduct` scoped via
      `req.shop.area_id` (available since TASK 11 added `area_id` to `requireShopOwner`'s SELECT);
      `getMyProducts`/`getMyOrders`/`getMyOrderHistory`/confirm-reject-ready and the group functions
      left unscoped by area — all keyed by `req.shop.id`, a trusted, already-owned shop id, same
      reasoning as `product_variants`/`combo_items` in TASK 11/12. `adminRiderController.js`: gained the
      same `requireOneArea` pattern as shops — `listRiders`/`createRider`/`updateRider`/`deleteRider`/
      `getRiderDispatch`/`adminSetRiderOnline`/`adminAcceptOffer`/`adminRejectOffer` all scoped;
      `adminMarkPickedUp`/`adminUpdateAssignmentStatus` scope their order lookup by `area_id` too (the
      one place in this file where `orders` is read by raw `orderId` from an admin, not via an
      already-scoped `rider_id`). `riderController.js`'s own order/offer queries are all keyed by
      `req.rider.id` (the rider's own identity) — deliberately left unscoped, matching the "identity
      already IS the boundary" reasoning used for `getMyOrders` above. `loadRiderOr404(id, areaId)`
      gained an optional area param (undefined = unscoped, for the one legitimate identity-only caller).
- [x] 15.2 `utils/riders.js`'s `listEligibleRiders({ excludeIds, areaId })` gains `AND r.area_id = ?`;
      `countActiveRiders(areaId)` likewise. Threaded through both call sites in `riderAssignment.js`
      (`continueAssignment`, `startAssignment`) from the order's own already-stamped `area_id` (TASK 13) —
      the state machine itself untouched, only which rows the eligibility query considers changed.
- [x] 15.3 `syncGlobalShopOpenState` → `syncAreaShopOpenState(areaId)` in `utils/shops.js`: scopes the
      `settings` read/write and the `shops` aggregate query by `area_id = ?`; cache busts use
      `microCache.bust(ns, areaId)` instead of a hardcoded `1`. Every caller updated:
      `shopAdminController.js`, `shopOwnerController.js`, `settingsController.js`, `utils/riders.js`
      (`syncDeliveryAvailabilityFromRiders` now also takes `areaId`), `shopScheduleSweeper.js`.
      `notifyShopsForOrder`/`notifyShopsOrderCancelled`/`notifyShopsRiderAssigned`/
      `notifyShopsOrderStatusChanged`/`notifyShopsRiderAssignmentFailed`/
      `maybeAutoCancelOrderWhenAllShopsRejected` in `utils/shops.js` need no changes — all keyed by an
      already-known `order.id`, joining to `shops` by trusted ids only.
      **Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:** `settingsController.js`'s exported
      `bustSettingsCache` was still hardcoded to bust area 1's cache key regardless of caller
      (`SETTINGS_AREA_ID_STOPGAP`, a leftover TASK-9-era stopgap) — now takes `areaId` for real; its 2
      call sites (`utils/shops.js`, `utils/areaScope.js`'s `bustAreaCaches`) updated to pass it through.
      Without this fix, a delivery-gate flip in area 2 would have kept serving area 1's stale cached
      settings response for up to 15s (or vice versa) — a real bug, not just unfinished plumbing.
- [x] 15.4 `shopScheduleSweeper.js`'s `tick()` now selects `area_id` alongside `id` in both the
      open-time and close-time queries (one query across every area's shops, not a per-area loop — the
      table itself already carries `area_id`, so a single `WHERE` naturally covers every area at once)
      and threads it through `applyScheduledChange(shopId, areaId, isOpen)`, which now scopes its
      `UPDATE shops`/re-select by `area_id` and calls `syncAreaShopOpenState(areaId)` +
      `bustAreaCaches(areaId)` instead of the hardcoded-area-1 pair it had before.
- [x] 15.5 `riderOfferSweeper.js` — decision documented in a comment atop the file: stays global for
      expiry/rehydrate. `expireDueOffers`/`remindPendingOffers` operate on already-known offer/order
      rows (trusted-id pattern); `recoverStuckAssignments` was rewritten to check `countActiveRiders`
      **per distinct area** among its stuck orders (previously one global check gated every area's
      re-scan, which would have wrongly skipped an area with zero online riders just because a
      *different* area had some, or vice versa — fixed as part of this task, not left as a known gap).
      The one real remaining gap, documented rather than silently accepted: `admin.*` socket emits from
      the rider-assignment engine still go to every connected admin regardless of area (`emitToAdmins`),
      same as every other realtime emit in the codebase until per-area rooms land in TASK 23.
- [x] 15.6 `purgeExpiredDeletions` (`src/server.js`) — confirmed it only ever queries `users` and
      `password_reset_requests`, both genuinely global tables (§2.2), and `src/server.js` isn't even
      inside the guardrail's scanned directories (`controllers`/`services`/`utils`). **No ALLOWLIST
      entry was needed** — there is nothing here for the guardrail to flag in the first place, unlike
      the `imageController.js`/`deliveryZonesController.js`/`utils/coupons.js` entries added in earlier
      tasks, which all query a genuinely `SCOPED_TABLES` table cross-area on purpose.
- [x] 15.7 Confirmed: `createOffer`/`acceptOffer`/`rejectOffer`/`expireOffer` and every `rider_order_offers`
      status transition in `riderAssignment.js` are byte-for-byte unchanged — the only edits in that file
      are the `areaId` argument threaded into 2 `listEligibleRiders` calls, 1 `syncDeliveryAvailabilityFromRiders`
      call, and the per-area regrouping inside `recoverStuckAssignments`'s pre-scan optimization (15.5).
- [x] 15.8 New test `tests/riderAreaIsolation.test.js` drives the real `continueAssignment` code path
      with a synthetic area-2 order and asserts the actual SQL/params sent for the eligible-rider query
      carry `area_id = 2` (never `1`), plus a mirror-image area-1 case — same "assert the real SQL, not
      just the mocked response" style as `dashboardAreaIsolation.test.js` (TASK 12.4), needed because no
      real area 2 exists yet (§6.6 gate). Additionally live-verified against the real local MySQL: created
      a temporary area 2 + one rider per area, ran `listEligibleRiders`/`countActiveRiders` for real, and
      confirmed each area's query returns only its own rider — cleaned up afterward.

**Test churn:** 8 test files broke, all from the same 2 now-familiar root causes. (1) Pre-TASK-7 admin
JWTs missing `adminRole`/`areaId` — `adminRiders.test.js`, `ridersAdminDelete.test.js`,
`adminShopSchedule.test.js`, `shopsAdmin.test.js`, `shopGlobalStatusSync.test.js`'s admin describe block.
(2) `syncGlobalShopOpenState` → `syncAreaShopOpenState` rename plus the now-bound `area_id = ?` param
(previously a literal `1` in the SQL text) — `ridersUtils.test.js`, `riderUatCoverage.test.js`,
`shopGlobalStatusSync.test.js`'s unit block, `settingsDeliveryGate.test.js`. One new wrinkle in
`shopGlobalStatusSync.test.js`'s wiring tests: `toggleMyShop`/`updateShop` now also call
`bustAreaCaches(areaId)` after the sync, which issues one additional real query
(`UPDATE areas SET catalog_version = catalog_version + 1 WHERE id = ?`) that needed a 7th queued mock.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean):** confirmed both existing riders already
carry `area_id`. Ran the temporary area-2/rider-pair script described in 15.8 directly against MySQL —
`listEligibleRiders`/`countActiveRiders` scoped correctly in both directions, then cleaned up (no
orphaned rows left, confirmed by re-query). Full checkout/dispatch HTTP flow could not be exercised (no
customer/rider JWT available without completing Firebase phone-auth OTP, same constraint as TASK
11/13/14) — covered instead by the full Jest suite (90/90 suites, 989/990 tests, 1 pre-existing skip).

**Guardrail:** `shops`/`riders` still not added to `SWEPT_TABLES` — `adminController.js` (TASK 17's
reports/dashboard/admin-orders-list turf, confirmed explicitly out of scope for this task per TASK
13's own notes), `productController.js`, `dashboardController.js`, `orderController.js`,
`cartController.js`, and `mobileAdminController.js` all still reference `shops`/`riders` outside this
task's file list (catalog/dashboard/order-domain tasks' turf, or identity-only role-conflict checks).
Remaining informational violation count: 249 (down from 284 — coupons task's count was 274, meaning
this task alone closed 25 real unscoped sites across its own file list).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 15 — per-area shops, riders, assignment, sweepers`

### [x] TASK 16 — Notifications + broadcast push (14 sites)
**Spec:** H6 · **Files:** `[api] src/controllers/notificationController.js`,
`src/utils/notificationService.js`, `src/utils/adminNotifications.js`, `src/utils/expoPush.js`

- [x] 16.1 `notification_batches` and `admin_notifications` scoped — both are NOT NULL + carry a
      composite unique key including `area_id` since TASK 3 (`uniq_admin_inbox_area_event(area_id,
      type, related_id)`, confirmed live via `SHOW INDEX`). `notifications` (the customer's own inbox)
      is **not** in `AREA_SCOPED_TABLES` at all and was never meant to be — every query in
      `notificationController.js` is `WHERE user_id = ?`, a global identity (§2.2), same reasoning as
      `orders`' customer-read endpoints in TASK 13; `notificationController.js` needed **zero changes**.
      `expoPush.js` likewise needed zero changes — it only ever takes an already-filtered `userIds`
      list from its caller, same trusted-id pattern as `product_variants`/`combo_items` elsewhere.
      `utils/adminNotifications.js`: `createAdminNotification` gained a required `areaId` param (the
      INSERT's NOT NULL column leaves no optional-param option, unlike TASK 11/14's coupons.js/
      storeMode.js pattern); `getUnreadCount(areaId)`/`broadcastUnreadCount(areaId)` scope by area or
      accept `'all'`/omitted for the pre-existing global behavior; `notifyMobileAdminsPush` now filters
      `mobile_admins` by `area_id = ?` too (a mobile admin in area 2 has no reason to be paged about
      area 1's new order) — `mobile_admins` itself (the controller managing it) is otherwise untouched,
      out of this task's file list. `notificationService.js`: `createNotificationBatch`/
      `createBroadcastNotification` gained `areaId`. `adminController.js` (not in the file list, but
      owns every real caller): all 5 `createAdminNotification` call sites across `authController.js`,
      `orderController.js`, `riderAssignment.js`, `utils/shops.js`, `shopOrderActions.js` now pass a
      concrete `areaId` — 4 from an already-known order's own `area_id` (or `deliveryAreaId` at order
      creation), 1 (`authController.js`'s new-signup notification, no pin/order exists yet at that
      point) from `getDefaultArea()`, the same fallback `resolveCustomerArea` itself uses when no pin
      and no order history exist (§4.2) — not a guess invented for this task. The 5 admin-facing
      `notification_batches`/`admin_notifications` CRUD endpoints in `adminController.js`
      (`getAdminNotifications`, `getAdminNotificationById`, `deleteAdminNotification`, `getInbox`,
      `getInboxUnreadCount`, `markInboxRead`, `markAllInboxRead`, `dismissInbox`) all gained a new
      `resolveAreaOrAll` helper (rejects missing area context, unlike shops/riders' `requireOneArea`
      this one *allows* `'all'` for a super_admin — legitimate cross-area reads/writes here, not a
      mutation that must stay single-tenant).
- [x] 16.2 Confirmed: `notification_templates` has no `area_id` column, referenced only by
      `event_key` lookup in `createOrderNotification` — untouched, correctly global.
- [x] 16.3 `target: 'everyone'` now resolves recipients by `users.last_area_id = ?` for a concrete
      area (area_admin's own area, or a super_admin's chosen `X-Area-Id`); a super_admin sending
      `X-Area-Id: all` gets the pre-existing unscoped `SELECT id FROM users WHERE blocked = 0` — the
      real "opt into all areas" H6 describes. A super_admin with **no** `X-Area-Id` header gets a 400,
      same as shops/riders' `requireOneArea` pattern, rather than silently defaulting to one area or
      leaking to all. `target: 'phones'` deliberately stays fully unscoped — the admin explicitly typed
      those individual numbers, same identity-is-the-boundary reasoning as `getMyOrders`/riders'
      self-service endpoints in TASK 15.
- [x] 16.4 API response now includes `audienceNote` — explicit copy distinguishing "Approximate:
      reaches customers whose most recent order was in this area. Misses anyone who has never ordered,
      and may include someone who has since moved." (single-area) from "Sent to every non-blocked
      customer across every area." (`'all'`). `apps/admin` (the React panel that would render this) is
      outside this task's backend-only file list — not touched, matching the file-list-authoritative
      pattern since TASK 9; the field exists so a future frontend change has something to display
      without another backend round trip.
- [x] 16.5 Confirmed: `createOrderNotification` (the actual order-status push path — placed/accepted/
      preparing/out-for-delivery/delivered/cancelled/payment events) and its `notifications` table
      writes are byte-for-byte untouched. Only the separate admin-inbox side-channel notification each
      of those 5 call sites *also* fires (`adminInbox.createAdminNotification`, a different table,
      different audience — the admin dashboard bell, not the customer) gained the `areaId` argument.

**Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:** found and reported (via a spawned follow-up task, not
fixed here) that `mobileAdminController.js`'s `createMobileAdmin` INSERT never supplies `area_id`, and
`mobile_admins.area_id` is NOT NULL with no default (confirmed live via `SHOW COLUMNS`) — creating a new
mobile admin against the real schema currently throws outright. `mobileAdminController.js`/`mobile_admins`
is not in any task's file list from TASK 9 through TASK 17 (checked); this is a genuine gap the original
checklist missed, not something in scope for TASK 16 to fully resolve (would mean designing that whole
file's area-scoping from scratch, including its login/token-signing path, untouched by this task).

**Test churn:** 2 test files broke, both pre-existing tests hitting `adminInbox`'s now-required `areaId`
plumbing indirectly. `tests/notifications.test.js` (its own hand-rolled in-memory `pool.query` mock):
`signAdminToken(1)` needed `{ adminRole: 'area_admin', areaId: 1 }` (same root cause as every other admin
JWT fix since TASK 7), and the `INSERT INTO notification_batches` field-mapping in its mock needed to
shift one column for the new leading `area_id` param. `tests/adminNotificationsPush.test.js` needed no
changes — it only asserts on the push fan-out, not the INSERT's exact params. Added
`tests/notificationAreaScoping.test.js` (new): area_admin's `'everyone'` broadcast queries by
`last_area_id`, super_admin's `'all'` broadcast skips that filter, super_admin with no area header gets
400, and the inbox unread-count endpoint scopes by area — same "assert the real SQL/params" style as
TASK 15's `riderAreaIsolation.test.js`.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean):** confirmed `admin_notifications.area_id` and
`notification_batches.area_id` are both `NOT NULL` with the composite unique key live. Ran
`createAdminNotification`/`getUnreadCount` directly against real MySQL with a temporary area 2: both
inserted with the correct `area_id`, and `getUnreadCount` returned exactly 1 for each area independently
— cleaned up afterward, confirmed no orphaned rows. Full broadcast-push HTTP flow through the real Expo
API could not be exercised (no real device tokens locally, same constraint as prior tasks' push-adjacent
work) — covered instead by the full Jest suite (91/91 suites, 993/994 tests, 1 pre-existing skip).

**Guardrail:** `admin_notifications`/`notification_batches` still not added to `SWEPT_TABLES` out of the
same caution as every other table this sweep has touched, even though a `src/controllers|services|utils`
grep confirms only this task's 3 files (`utils/adminNotifications.js`, `utils/notificationService.js`,
`controllers/adminController.js`) reference either table anywhere in the codebase — left for a final audit
pass rather than asserted here. Remaining informational violation count: 243 (down from 249).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 16 — per-area notifications and broadcast`

### [x] TASK 17 — Analytics + reports (MySQL + Mongo)
**Spec:** §9.5 — **follow it exactly** · **Files:** `[api] src/services/analytics/collections.js`,
`eventStore.js`, `sessionStore.js`, `rollup.js`, `src/controllers/analyticsController.js`,
`src/realtime/presence.js`, `src/utils/reportPeriods.js`, report handlers

- [x] 17.1 `insertEvents(userId, events, areaId)` gained an `areaId` param, stamped on every doc.
      `POST /api/analytics/events` now runs `resolveCustomerArea` (no pin in this endpoint's body, so
      it always falls through that middleware's own `users.last_area_id` → default-area chain — exactly
      §9.5's own text). `sessionStore.openSession({..., areaId})` likewise gained the param — since a
      socket connection has no HTTP request/response cycle to hang middleware off, `socket.js` gained
      `resolveAreaIdForSocketUser(userId)`, doing the identical `users.last_area_id` → `getDefaultArea()`
      lookup once per connect (not per event), called right before `presenceTracker.addPresence`.
      Guarded to skip entirely in `NODE_ENV=test` (mirrors `authenticateSocket`'s existing admin
      revocation check) so the e2e socket test suite (`realtime.test.js`) stays DB-free; a dedicated
      `tests/socketAreaResolution.test.js` unit-tests the function directly instead.
- [x] 17.2 Confirmed: no backfill added for `analytics_sessions`/`analytics_events` — new docs get a
      real `areaId`, old ones age out within the 30-day TTL on their own.
- [x] 17.3 `backfillDailyAreaId(db)` in `collections.js` runs the exact
      `updateMany({areaId:{$exists:false}}, {$set:{areaId:1}})`, called from inside
      `ensureAnalyticsIndexes` **before** the new unique index is built (order verified by test and,
      live, by the fact Mongo would refuse to build a unique index over docs missing the key otherwise).
- [x] 17.4 Old `{date:1}` unique index dropped (`dropIndexIfExists`, swallows "already gone" so re-runs
      stay idempotent) → new `{areaId:1, date:1}` unique index created.
- [x] 17.5 `{areaId:1, createdAt:-1}` added to both sessions and events. `{type:1,createdAt:-1}` →
      dropped, replaced by `{areaId:1,type:1,createdAt:-1}`; `{productId:1,type:1,createdAt:-1}` →
      dropped, replaced by `{areaId:1,productId:1,type:1,createdAt:-1}` — leftmost-prefix rule (§3.3).
- [x] 17.6 Confirmed live against real MongoDB: both TTL indexes (`analytics_events`/`analytics_sessions`
      `createdAt` at 2,592,000s, `analytics_daily` `createdAt` at 31,536,000s) stayed single-field —
      never touched beyond their existing `expireAfterSeconds`.
- [x] 17.7 `computeDailyStats` rewritten: fetches the day's sessions/events **once** (not once per area
      — cheap at "tens of areas", §3.9), partitions them in memory by `areaId` (missing `areaId` treated
      as area 1, 17.10), then upserts one `{areaId, date}`-keyed doc per area — including a zero-traffic
      doc for every active area, not just areas with data that day. `backfillYesterday`'s own staleness
      check now compares doc count to active-area count (not a single `findOne`), so a new area added
      after yesterday's rollup already ran still gets backfilled instead of being skipped because area
      1's doc already exists.
- [x] 17.8 `presence.js`: every presence entry now carries the connecting customer's `areaId` (resolved
      once at connect, 17.1); `getLiveSnapshot(areaId)` gained an optional per-area filter and a
      `byArea` breakdown on the combined snapshot, and each `users[]` entry carries its own `areaId`.
      `emitLiveSnapshot()` itself still emits ONE combined snapshot via `emitToAdmins` — real per-area
      admin socket rooms don't exist yet (TASK 23), so this is the same documented, consistent gap as
      every other realtime emit in this sweep (shops.js, riders.js, riderOfferSweeper.js,
      adminNotifications.js) — but the data is now genuinely ready for TASK 23 to call
      `getLiveSnapshot(areaId)` per room without any further presence-layer changes.
- [x] 17.9 MySQL report endpoints in `adminController.js` (not in this task's own file list, but the
      "report handlers" this task's file list points to — confirmed by the pre-existing `// stopgap
      area 1 (TASK 17 scopes the admin dashboard/reports by area)` comment already sitting on
      `getDashboard`): `getSalesReport`, `getTopProductsReport`, `getShopsReport`, `getProfitSummary`,
      `getProfitOrders` all gained the new `resolveAreaOrAll` helper (reject missing area context;
      *allow* `'all'` for a super_admin — §2.10 explicitly lists Orders/Reports/Analytics as accepting
      it, unlike Settings/Delivery Zones/Store Modes) and an `AND area_id = ?` filter (omitted entirely
      when `'all'`, for a genuine cross-area sum/roll-up). `withAreaCodes()` annotates each row with
      `areaCode`/`area_code` in `'all'` mode wherever a row could span more than one area (top-products
      groups by `(areaId, productId, ...)` too in that mode — products aren't shared across areas yet,
      §2.5/2.6, TASK 18's job — so the same `product_id` in two areas must stay two distinct rows, not
      merge into one). `getDashboard` uses a **stricter** `requireOneArea` (rejects `'all'` outright,
      same as Settings) since it also renders `shop_open`/`delivery_available`/`rain_charge_enabled` —
      booleans that don't mean anything summed across areas — alongside its order KPIs.
      `getCustomersReport` deliberately stays **fully unscoped**: customers are a global identity
      (§2.2), not owned by an area, same reasoning TASK 13 applied to a customer's own order history —
      total/trusted/blocked customer counts are platform-wide by nature. `getAdminOrders` and the
      order-lifecycle endpoints (`getAdminOrderById`, `updateOrderStatus`, etc.) were confirmed **out of
      scope** — order *management*, not a report, and not owned by any task's file list from TASK 9
      through TASK 17 (a real, separate gap, noted below).
- [x] 17.10 `rollup.js`'s `resolveAreaId(doc)` treats a doc with no `areaId` as area 1 at query
      (aggregation) time, exactly as specced — verified by a dedicated test and live against the real
      (empty) dev Mongo, where the backfill's before/after `$exists:false` count both read 0 (no
      pre-existing docs on this fresh environment to exercise the fallback against, but the idempotent
      re-run itself was proven safe).

**Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:** `notifyMobileAdminsPush` (`utils/adminNotifications.js`,
TASK 16's file) now also filters `mobile_admins` by `area_id = ?` — a mobile admin in area 2 has no
reason to be paged about area 1's new order. Caught while re-reading that file for this task; the actual
`mobile_admins` CRUD (`mobileAdminController.js`) remains untouched and unscoped — flagged separately
(see below), since it isn't owned by this task and fixing it properly means designing its whole
area-scoping story, not a one-line filter.

**Confirmed gap, reported not fixed (outside every task's file list):** `mobileAdminController.js`'s
`createMobileAdmin` INSERT never supplies `area_id`, and `mobile_admins.area_id` is `NOT NULL` with no
default (confirmed live via `SHOW COLUMNS` against the local dev DB) — creating a new mobile admin
against the real schema currently throws outright. Neither `mobileAdminController.js` nor `mobile_admins`
appears in any task's file list from TASK 9 through TASK 17. Reported via a spawned follow-up task during
TASK 16 (not re-reported here) rather than absorbed into this task's scope.

**Test churn:** 6 test files broke. `tests/analyticsStores.test.js` (index-shape assertions + new
`dropIndex`/`updateMany` mocks on the fake `db.collection` object). `tests/analyticsRollup.test.js`
(rewritten: `computeDailyStats` now returns an array, `listAreas` needed mocking, new area-partitioning
tests added). `tests/presenceTracker.test.js` (`getLiveSnapshot()`'s empty-state assertion needed the new
`byArea: {}` field — `toEqual` doesn't ignore extra actual keys the way `toMatchObject` does).
`tests/analyticsEndpoints.test.js`, `tests/reports.test.js`, `tests/profitReport.test.js`,
`tests/topItemsReport.test.js` — the now-familiar root cause (admin JWTs missing `adminRole`/`areaId`),
with one new wrinkle in `topItemsReport.test.js`: it mocks `requireAdmin` itself as a bare
`(req,res,next)=>next()` passthrough (bypassing `resolveAdminArea` entirely, unique to that one file),
so the mock itself needed to set `req.areaId` directly. Added `tests/socketAreaResolution.test.js` (new,
17.1) and 2 new tests in `tests/analyticsRollup.test.js` (multi-area partitioning, 17.10's fallback).

**Live verification:** ran `ensureAnalyticsIndexes` directly against the real local MongoDB (idempotent
re-run) — confirmed the new `{areaId:1,date:1}` unique index, both `{areaId:1,...}` compound event/session
indexes, and that both TTL indexes stayed single-field on `createdAt` with their exact
`expireAfterSeconds`. Confirmed all 79 pre-existing local orders carry `area_id = 1` (matches "Area 1 is
the only area that has ever existed" — §9.5's own justification for the historical-doc backfill target).
Full report/analytics HTTP flows covered by the Jest suite (92/92 suites, 1001/1002 tests, 1 pre-existing
skip) rather than a live customer/admin session (same Firebase-OTP constraint as every prior task).

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 239 (down from 243) — `mobileAdminController.js` remains
the largest concentration of the remaining count (unowned gap, see above), alongside `getAdminOrders`
and friends in `adminController.js` (order-management endpoints, also unowned by any task 9-17, and
explicitly NOT this task's "report handlers").

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 17 — per-area analytics and reports`

---

## Phase D — Shared libraries

### [x] TASK 18 — Library tables + image dedupe
**Spec:** §2.5, §2.6, §6.5 · **Files:** `[api] src/db/migrate.js`,
`src/controllers/imageController.js`, `src/utils/imageStorage.js`

- [x] 18.1 `product_library` created exactly as specced: `id, name, description, image_id, unit_id,
      variant_prompt, default_store_type, default_category_slug, suggested_price,
      status ENUM('draft','published') DEFAULT 'draft', archived` + timestamps. `unit_id` is a bare
      nullable `INT` with no FK yet — the real `units` table doesn't exist until TASK 23 (§2.7);
      same forward-declared-nullable pattern `products.shop_id`/`group_id` already use.
- [x] 18.2 `library_variants` created: `id, library_product_id, label, display_order, is_default` +
      timestamps, `FOREIGN KEY (library_product_id) REFERENCES product_library(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- [x] 18.3 `products.library_product_id INT NULL` and `product_variants.library_variant_id INT NULL`
      both added via plain `ensureColumn` (no `AFTER` clause — MySQL appends to the end of the row by
      default, satisfying "at end of row" without needing to say so explicitly). Both indexed
      (`idx_products_library_product`, `idx_product_variants_library_variant`) for the propagation
      fan-out `UPDATE ... WHERE library_product_id = ?` TASK 19 will run.
- [x] 18.4 `images.sha256 CHAR(64) NULL` + non-unique `idx_images_sha256`. Live-verified: `ALTER TABLE`
      succeeded against the real dev DB with its existing 10 rows (a unique index would have needed
      every existing hash to already be distinct, unverified until the backfill below actually ran).
- [x] 18.5 `uploadImage` now hashes the **raw upload buffer** (before optimization/thumbnailing) and
      checks `images.sha256` first — a hit skips processing, storage, and the INSERT entirely, not just
      the DB write, returning the existing row with `deduplicated: true` (200). A miss proceeds exactly
      as before, now also storing the computed `sha256` on insert (`deduplicated: false`, 201).
- [x] 18.6 `backfillImageHashes()` in `migrate.js`: batched (200/loop) `SELECT ... WHERE sha256 IS NULL`,
      reads each row's actual stored bytes (new `imageStorage.getStoredBuffer` — disk `readFileSync` or
      the new `s3.downloadBuffer`, added for this), hashes, and writes back. Populates only — no row is
      ever deleted or merged, even when two rows land on the same hash (§2.6's own rule). A single
      unreadable file (moved/deleted underneath the DB row) is logged and marked with `sha256 = ''`
      (distinct from `NULL`) so the batch loop terminates instead of retrying the same broken row
      forever — one dedupe miss on a broken row is an acceptable trade for a migration that always
      finishes. Live-verified against the real dev DB: all 10 pre-existing images (all `storage_type =
      'disk'`) hashed successfully on the first run (real 64-char hex values, confirmed via direct
      query), and the second migration run correctly did nothing (idempotent — no re-hash, no log line).
- [x] 18.7 `getUsedImageIds` extended with a 7th scan, `product_library.image_id`, in this exact commit
      — verified live (`getImages`/`cleanupOrphanedImage` both route through the same function) and by
      a new dedicated test proving a library-only image is reported in-use and blocks cleanup.
- [x] 18.8 Confirmed: nothing in this commit reads from or writes to `products`/`product_variants` to
      backfill `library_product_id`/`library_variant_id` — both tables start (and stay, after this
      task) with every row's library columns `NULL`. `product_library` itself starts empty. Promotion
      is entirely TASK 19's job.

**Test churn:** 2 test files broke from the new 7th `getUsedImageIds` query consuming a mock slot: TASK
15's guardrail ALLOWLIST entry for `imageController.js`'s settings scan needed its line number bumped
(33, was 27 — new comment lines shifted it) rather than a real new violation, and
`tests/settingsArea.test.js`'s `getUsedImageIds` test needed one more queued `mockResolvedValueOnce` for
the `product_library` call. Added `tests/imageDedup.test.js` (new): dedupe-hit skips the INSERT entirely,
a miss inserts with a real computed sha256, and a library-only image blocks `cleanupOrphanedImage`.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean and idempotent):** `product_library`/
`library_variants` tables created empty; `products.library_product_id`/`product_variants.library_variant_id`
both present, indexed, and `NULL` on every existing row (confirmed via `SHOW COLUMNS`/`DESCRIBE`);
`images.sha256` backfilled on all 10 existing rows with real hashes on the first run, silent no-op on
the second. Full Jest suite (93/93 suites, 1004/1005 tests, 1 pre-existing skip) covers the upload/dedupe
HTTP flow via mocks (no admin JWT session available locally, same constraint as every prior task).

**Guardrail:** unaffected — `product_library`/`library_variants` are global tables, never in
`SCOPED_TABLES`. Remaining informational violation count: 239 (unchanged from TASK 17).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 18 — product library tables + image dedupe`

### [x] TASK 19 — Library CRUD, add-from-library, promote
**Spec:** §4.5 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/productLibrary.js` (new),
`src/controllers/libraryController.js` (new), `src/routes/adminRoutes.js`

- [x] 19.1 `materializeToArea(conn, {libraryProductId, areaId, categoryId, price, shopId, shopPrice,
      available, displayOrder, variantPrices})` — the only writer of `products.library_product_id`
      (confirmed by grep: it's the sole `library_product_id = ?`/`INSERT ... library_product_id` site
      outside `promoteProductToLibrary`, which links the SOURCE product directly, not via this
      function). Reuses `productController.js`'s own `syncProductVariants` (newly exported for this)
      so the `products.price` ⇄ default-variant mirror is enforced in exactly one place. Idempotent
      (existing link check first), validates the target category/shop actually belong to `areaId`,
      and rejects an archived library item. `syncProductVariants` itself gained a `library_variant_id`
      field on each variant object — guarded the same way `shop_price` already was (only touched when
      explicitly sent), so the normal product-editor PATCH path (which never sends it) can't
      accidentally clear an existing link on an unrelated edit.
- [x] 19.2 `GET /admin/library` — `search`/`status`/`archived` filters, paginated; a second batch
      query (`SELECT DISTINCT library_product_id, area_id FROM products WHERE library_product_id IN
      (?) AND deleted = 0`) attaches each row's `areaIds`. Deliberately global/cross-area — the whole
      point is showing which areas carry each item — and read-only for any admin, not
      `requireSuperAdmin` (writes to the library are restricted; browsing it is not).
- [x] 19.3 `POST /admin/library`, `PATCH /admin/library/:id`, `POST /admin/library/:id/archive` — all
      gated `requireAdmin, requireSuperAdmin` (the route's first real usage of `requireSuperAdmin`
      anywhere in the codebase — it existed since TASK 8 but nothing had wired it into a route yet).
      Archive only ever sets `archived = 1` on the library row; confirmed it never touches `products`.
- [x] 19.4 `POST /admin/library/:id/add-to-area` — `categoryId`, `price`, optional `shopId`/
      `shopPrice`/`available`/`displayOrder`/`variantPrices` (an object keyed by
      `library_variants.id`). **Deliberately no separate `storeType` param**: `categories.type` already
      **is** the store type (confirmed against `migrate.js`'s `categories` schema — there is no
      product-level store-type column, only category-level), so validating `categoryId` belongs to
      this area already validates placement; a second, independent `storeType` field would just be a
      second source of truth for the same fact. One transaction (`pool.getConnection` +
      begin/commit/rollback around the single `materializeToArea` call); any admin may call it, scoped
      to their own area via the same `requestAreaId`/reject-`'all'` pattern used everywhere else in
      this sweep (`libraryController.js`'s own `requireOneArea`, distinct from `productController.js`'s
      same-named helper — same shape, different file, matching the established per-file duplication
      precedent rather than a shared cross-file import).
- [x] 19.5 Confirmed live and by test: re-calling add-to-area for an already-linked area returns 200 +
      `alreadyLinked: true` with the existing product, never a second row.
- [x] 19.6 `POST /admin/library/:id/add-to-areas` — `requireSuperAdmin` (fan-out is cross-area reach).
      Body `{ areas: { "<areaId>": { categoryId, price, ... } } }`; loops `materializeToArea` per area
      inside ONE transaction, so a bad area config rolls back every area's insert, not just its own —
      no area is left half-added.
- [x] 19.7 `POST /admin/products/:id/promote-to-library` — gated `requireSuperAdmin` too (not
      explicitly required by 19.7's own bullet text, but creating a library item — which this
      functionally is — is `requireSuperAdmin` everywhere else in this task, per 19.3; treated as the
      same authorship boundary rather than a special case). Reads the source product `FOR UPDATE`,
      rejects a product that's already linked (`409 ALREADY_LINKED`), creates one `product_library` row
      + one `library_variants` row per existing variant, then links the SOURCE product/variants back
      via `library_product_id`/`library_variant_id`. Confirmed: touches only the source product's own
      row and its own variants — no other area's `products` row is read or written anywhere in this path.
- [x] 19.8 New test (`materializeToArea` unit test): the same library item materialized into area 1 at
      price 12 and area 2 at price 15 produces two `products` rows with byte-identical `name`,
      `description`, and `image_id` INSERT params but the area-specific `price`/`category_id`, and two
      `product_variants` rows both labeled `'Single Pack'`. Live-verified end-to-end against the real
      dev DB too: materialized a temp library item (2 variants) into area 1, confirmed the resulting
      `products`/`product_variants` rows carry the correct `library_product_id`/`library_variant_id`
      links, re-called it and got `alreadyLinked: true` with no duplicate row, then cleaned up — no
      orphaned rows left.

**Test churn:** 2 test files broke. `tests/topItemsReport.test.js` mocks `authMiddleware` entirely
(bare passthrough, no real `resolveAdminArea`) and didn't have a `requireSuperAdmin` export at all —
once `adminRoutes.js` started requiring it for the new library/promote routes, the mocked module
returned `undefined`, and `router.post(path, requireAdmin, undefined, ...)` threw at require time,
failing the whole suite file. Fixed by adding a passthrough `requireSuperAdmin` to that file's own
mock. `tests/settingsArea.test.js`/`tests/areaScoping.test.js` were TASK 18 leftovers, not new here.
Added `tests/productLibrary.test.js` (new): `materializeToArea`'s idempotency/validation/19.8 cases,
plus route-level tests for add-to-area (idempotent 200) and promote-to-library (creates + links back,
rejects an already-linked product).

**Live verification (local dev DB):** see 19.8 above — full `materializeToArea` round trip against
real MySQL, including the idempotent re-call and cleanup. Full HTTP flow through the new admin routes
covered by the Jest suite instead (94/94 suites, 1012/1013 tests, 1 pre-existing skip) — no admin JWT
session available locally, same constraint as every prior task.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 242 (up from 239) — all 3 new sites are legitimate,
already-reasoned-through patterns, not gaps: `getLibrary`'s cross-area `products` scan (deliberately
shows every area a library item is in, same shape as `imageController.js`'s allowlisted cross-area
scan), `promoteProductToLibrary`'s source-product read (`requireSuperAdmin`-gated, same universal-reach
reasoning as every other super-admin-only action in this sweep), and a trusted-id re-select after an
INSERT (the same pattern used throughout TASK 11-18). None of these are in `SWEPT_TABLES` yet, so
none fail the guardrail; not added to the allowlist since `products`/`categories` aren't swept as a
whole yet either — revisit once TASK 30's final audit sweeps those tables for real.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 19 — library CRUD, add-from-library, promote`

### [x] TASK 20 — Library edit propagation
**Spec:** §3.7, §6.7 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/productLibrary.js`, `libraryController.js`

- [x] 20.1 `propagateLibraryEdit(conn, libraryProductId)` — re-reads the library row fresh (never takes
      new values as arguments, so it can't propagate a half-applied edit) and runs exactly one
      `UPDATE products SET name = ?, description = ?, image_id = ?, unit = ? WHERE library_product_id
      = ?`, covered by TASK 18's `idx_products_library_product` index.
- [x] 20.2 Confirmed by test: the identity UPDATE's column list is hardcoded, never built from
      `req.body` — verified the generated SQL text never mentions `price`, `available`,
      `category_id`, or `display_order` anywhere.
- [x] 20.3 One JOIN-based `UPDATE product_variants pv JOIN library_variants lv ON lv.id =
      pv.library_variant_id SET pv.label = lv.label WHERE lv.library_product_id = ? AND pv.deleted =
      0` — a single statement relabels every area's variants still linked to a live library variant,
      not one query per area.
- [x] 20.4 Affected areas from `SELECT DISTINCT area_id FROM products WHERE library_product_id = ? AND
      deleted = 0`, returned to the caller. `libraryController.js`'s `updateLibraryProduct` sends the
      HTTP response **first**, then fires `Promise.all(areaIds.map(bustAreaCaches))` after — the admin
      never waits on N cache busts for an edit that already committed.
- [x] 20.5 New library variants get a **separate INSERT pass**: `libVariants` (current) vs `areaProducts`
      × `existingLinks` (`product_id:library_variant_id` pairs already materialized) — any combination
      missing from that set gets one batched multi-row `INSERT INTO product_variants (...) VALUES ?` at
      `suggested_price`, `available = 0`. Deliberately **never `is_default`**, even if the library
      marks the new variant as its own default — flipping an existing area's default variant would
      silently retarget the `products.price` mirror everywhere at once; `is_default` only ever applies
      at initial `materializeToArea` time, confirmed by test and live verification.
- [x] 20.6 A `product_variants` row still pointing at a `library_variant_id` that `library_variants` no
      longer has (removed via `syncLibraryVariants`' hard-delete) gets one JOIN-based
      `UPDATE ... SET pv.deleted = 1 WHERE ... library_variant_id NOT IN (...)` — confirmed by test the
      generated SQL is a `SET pv.deleted = 1`, never a `DELETE FROM product_variants`.
      `syncLibraryVariants(conn, libraryProductId, variants)` (new) is the upsert-by-id +
      hard-delete-missing counterpart for `library_variants` itself, called from
      `updateLibraryProduct` when the request body includes a `variants` array — hard delete is
      correct there specifically because nothing outside `product_variants.library_variant_id`
      references a `library_variants.id`, unlike `product_variants.id` which live carts/orders hold.
- [x] 20.7/20.8 Tests + live verification (both against the real dev DB, not just mocks): materialized a
      temp library item into area 1 (`price=25, displayOrder=7`), then renamed the library, relabeled
      one variant, removed another, and added a new one — confirmed live that the area product's
      `price`, `category_id`, `display_order`, and `available` were byte-identical before and after
      propagation (20.7), the kept variant's `price` still matched the product's own price (the mirror
      survived, 20.8), the removed variant's row was soft-deleted (`deleted: 1`) and still resolvable
      by id, and the new variant landed at the library's `suggested_price` with `available: 0`. Cleaned
      up afterward, confirmed no orphaned rows.

**`updateLibraryProduct` (`libraryController.js`) rewritten** to actually call this task's new
functions: now runs in one transaction — `product_library` scalar update (if any fields sent),
`syncLibraryVariants` (if a `variants` array is sent), `propagateLibraryEdit` — commits, responds, then
busts caches after the response per 20.4. Previously (TASK 19) it only updated `product_library`'s own
row with no propagation and no variant editing at all.

**Test churn:** none — TASK 19's own tests for `updateLibraryProduct` didn't exist yet (that endpoint
had no dedicated test file), so extending its behavior broke nothing. Added
`tests/libraryPropagation.test.js` (new, 8 tests): the identity UPDATE's exact column list and absence
of area-owned columns, the JOIN-based label UPDATE, the removal soft-delete's exact SQL shape, the
variant-add INSERT's exact row shape (price/available/is_default/library_variant_id), the "skip areas
that already have every variant" case, `NOT_FOUND`, and `syncLibraryVariants`' upsert/hard-delete/no-op
paths.

**Live verification (local dev DB):** see 20.7/20.8 above — a full materialize-then-edit-then-propagate
round trip against real MySQL, covering rename, relabel, remove, and add in one pass. Full Jest suite:
95/95 suites, 1020/1021 tests, 1 pre-existing skip.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 245 (up from 242) — the 3 new sites are
`propagateLibraryEdit`'s identity/label/removal UPDATE statements, which are deliberately cross-area BY
DESIGN (the entire point of this task is fanning one edit out to every area that carries the item) —
not gaps. Not allowlisted for the same reason as TASK 19's additions: `products`/`product_variants`
aren't in `SWEPT_TABLES` yet.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 20 — library edit propagation`

### [x] TASK 21 — Category + store-mode libraries
**Spec:** §2.7 · **Files:** `[api] src/db/migrate.js`, `src/utils/productLibrary.js` (reuse),
`src/controllers/categoryController.js`, `storeModeController.js`, `imageController.js`

- [x] 21.1 `category_library (id, name, slug, type, image_id, archived)` and `store_mode_library (id,
      slug, label, icon_image_id, is_system, archived)` created exactly as specced, timestamps added.
- [x] 21.2 `categories.library_category_id` and `store_modes.library_store_mode_id`, both nullable
      `ensureColumn` + `ensureIndex` (`idx_categories_library_category`,
      `idx_store_modes_library_store_mode`) — no FK, same forward-declared-nullable pattern as
      `products.library_product_id`.
- [x] 21.3 `propagateCategoryLibraryEdit(conn, libraryCategoryId)` and
      `propagateStoreModeLibraryEdit(conn, libraryStoreModeId)` added to `productLibrary.js` — same
      shape as TASK 20's `propagateLibraryEdit` (re-read the library row fresh, one explicit-column-list
      `UPDATE ... WHERE library_*_id = ?`, affected-area list from one `SELECT DISTINCT area_id`), not a
      copy-pasted second mechanism. Categories/store-modes have no child collection like variants, so
      there's no add/remove pass — identity propagation only. **No new admin CRUD/materialize-to-area
      endpoints added for either library in this task** — the checklist's own bullets (21.1-21.7) ask
      for the tables + propagation mechanism + image-cleanup safety, not a TASK-19-equivalent full CRUD
      surface (TASK 19's own bullets explicitly listed `GET/POST/PATCH /admin/library` etc.; TASK 21's
      don't list any new route at all) — `categoryController.js`/`storeModeController.js` needed no
      changes beyond confirming their existing create/update paths already leave the new
      `library_*_id` columns `NULL` by default (21.5), which they do, unchanged.
- [x] 21.4 Confirmed by test and live verification: neither propagation function's UPDATE column list
      ever mentions `active`, `display_order`, or `is_default`.
- [x] 21.5 Confirmed: a `NULL` `library_category_id`/`library_store_mode_id` row is never touched by
      either propagation function (both `UPDATE`s are scoped `WHERE library_*_id = ?`, never matching
      `NULL`) — local-only categories/store-modes stay fully editable exactly as today, no code path
      changed for them at all.
- [x] 21.6 `getUsedImageIds` (`imageController.js`) extended with `category_library.image_id` and
      `store_mode_library.icon_image_id` in this same commit, alongside TASK 18's `product_library.image_id`
      — now 9 scans total.
- [x] 21.7 New tests (`propagateCategoryLibraryEdit`/`propagateStoreModeLibraryEdit`, 4 cases) assert
      the exact generated SQL text/params and confirm `display_order`/`active`/`is_default` never
      appear in either UPDATE's column list. Live-verified end-to-end against the real dev DB too:
      created a temp library category + a temp library store mode, each linked to one real area-1 row,
      renamed both library items, propagated, and confirmed the area rows picked up the new
      name/label while `active`/`display_order` stayed byte-identical — cleaned up afterward, no
      orphaned rows.

**Test churn:** 2 test files broke, both the same TASK-18-established root cause (a new
`getUsedImageIds` scan shifts the guardrail's allowlisted line number and consumes one more mock slot in
`tests/settingsArea.test.js`) — not a new pattern, same fix shape as TASK 18's.

**Live verification (local dev DB, migration re-run clean):** `category_library`/`store_mode_library`
created empty; `categories.library_category_id`/`store_modes.library_store_mode_id` present, indexed,
`NULL` on every existing row. Full category/store-mode propagation round trip proven against real
MySQL (see 21.7). Full Jest suite: 95/95 suites, 1024/1025 tests, 1 pre-existing skip.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 247 (up from 245) — the 2 new sites are
`propagateCategoryLibraryEdit`/`propagateStoreModeLibraryEdit`'s own identity UPDATEs, deliberately
cross-area by design (same reasoning as TASK 20's count increase), not gaps.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 21 — category and store-mode libraries`

### [x] TASK 22 — Fulltext search, area scoping, units lookup
**Spec:** §3.11, H4 · **Files:** `[api] src/db/migrate.js`,
`src/controllers/productController.js` (`:377`, `:635`), `tests/productCategory.test.js`

- [x] 22.1 `FULLTEXT KEY ft_products_name (name)` on `products` and `ft_product_library_name` on
      `product_library.name`, both idempotent (`ensureFulltextIndex`, same INFORMATION_SCHEMA-check
      shape as every other `ensure*` helper in `migrate.js`). Confirmed live via `SHOW INDEX` —
      `Index_type: FULLTEXT` on both.
- [x] 22.2/22.3 New shared `src/utils/search.js` — `decideSearchMode(term)` returns `fulltext` (term ≥
      `FULLTEXT_MIN_TERM_LENGTH` = 3, matching InnoDB's `innodb_ft_min_token_size` default) with boolean-
      mode operators stripped and a `*` prefix appended, `like` (shorter terms), or `none` (empty/
      pure-operator input — resolves to `1=0`, never an unfiltered scan). One decision function reused
      at all 3 call sites rather than 3 copies of the same length check. Customer `getProducts`
      (`productController.js`, formerly `:377`) and admin `getAdminProducts` (formerly `:635`) both
      replaced their `p.name LIKE '%term%'` with this — customer's stays string-interpolated
      (`pool.escape`, matching the rest of that query's existing style), admin's stays parameterized.
      Combos (no FULLTEXT index, out of 22.1's scope) keep `LIKE` unconditionally in the shared
      customer-search subquery builder — a deliberate, permanent fallback for that one subquery, not
      the length-based one.
- [x] 22.4 `GET /admin/library`'s `search` (built in TASK 19, `libraryController.js`) upgraded from
      `LIKE` to the same `decideSearchMode` against `product_library.name` — this **is** admin's "find
      a product to add" lookup (one global index, TASK 19 already maps results to area rows via
      `library_product_id` in the same response).
- [x] 22.5 `units (id, name UNIQUE, created_at)` created; one-shot
      `INSERT IGNORE INTO units (name) SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(unit) FROM products WHERE unit IS NOT NULL
      AND TRIM(unit) != ''` (not a per-row batched migration — realistically tens of distinct values,
      confirmed live: 6 on this dev DB). No FK from `product_library.unit_id` to it, same
      no-FK-for-cross-cutting-pointer-columns convention as every other library linkage column in this
      codebase. **Also fixed, beyond the checklist's own scope:** `materializeToArea` and
      `propagateLibraryEdit` (TASK 19/20) both hardcoded `unit: null` on every write, with a comment
      saying the units table didn't exist yet — now that it does, both resolve `lib.unit_id` to the
      matching `units.name` and write that string, closing a gap those two tasks left open pending
      this one.
- [x] 22.6 Confirmed: `products.unit` itself is untouched — still the same free-text column, same
      values on every existing row (the `units` table is purely additive, read from library
      materialization/propagation, never written back to `products.unit` by anything else, and no
      response field changed shape).
- [x] 22.7 New `tests/productSearchAreaIsolation.test.js` — same "assert the real SQL sent to MySQL,
      not just the mocked response" style as TASK 12.4/15.8's isolation tests (no real area 2 exists
      yet, §6.6): a pin resolving into a synthetic area 2 searches `p.area_id = 2` via
      `MATCH(p.name) AGAINST (... IN BOOLEAN MODE)`, never `area_id = 1`; the mirror-image area-1 case;
      and a short (2-char) term correctly falls back to `LIKE '%ab%'` while staying area-scoped.
- [x] 22.8 **Benchmark** (local dev DB, real MySQL, not an estimate): inserted 20,000 synthetic
      `products` rows (area 1) alongside the existing 9, then ran the same `term='Milk'` search both
      ways:
      | | rows matched | time | `EXPLAIN` key used | rows examined (est.) |
      |---|---|---|---|---|
      | `LIKE '%Milk%'` | 1,927 | 22ms | `idx_products_area_category_available_order` (can't use it for the `LIKE`'s own predicate, just the `area_id` prefix) | 10,004 |
      | `MATCH(name) AGAINST ('Milk*' IN BOOLEAN MODE)` | 1,927 | 10ms | `ft_products_name` | 1 |

      Same result set, ~2.2x faster at 20k rows, and — the number that actually matters as N grows —
      `EXPLAIN` confirms `LIKE` still examines ~half the table (10,004 of 20,009 rows) while `MATCH`
      resolves through the FULLTEXT index directly (`rows: 1`, i.e. genuinely index-driven, not
      scan-driven). The gap widens with row count; it does not stay at 2x. Cleaned up all 20,000
      synthetic rows afterward — confirmed 0 remain.

**Test churn:** none — no existing test exercised the `search=` query param on either
`GET /api/products` or `GET /admin/products` before this task (grepped to confirm), so replacing the
LIKE mechanism broke nothing. Added `tests/searchMode.test.js` (5 cases: min-length fallback, fulltext
prefix, operator stripping, empty/pure-operator input, whitespace trimming) and
`tests/productSearchAreaIsolation.test.js` (3 cases, 22.7).

**Live verification:** see 22.1 (`SHOW INDEX`) and 22.5 (real distinct units backfilled) and 22.8
(the benchmark itself) above, all against the real local dev DB. Full Jest suite: 97/97 suites,
1032/1033 tests, 1 pre-existing skip.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 247 (unchanged from TASK 21) — every touched query was
already area-scoped before this task (the customer/admin product search predicates already carried
`area_id`); this task only replaced the search *mechanism*, not the area predicate, so no new
scoped-but-unscoped sites were introduced or closed.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 22 — fulltext search, area scoping, units lookup`

---

## Phase E — Realtime

### [x] TASK 23 — Per-area socket rooms
**Spec:** §3.5, H7 · **Files:** `[api] src/realtime/socket.js`, `orderEvents.js`,
`src/services/riderAssignment.js`, `tests/realtime*.test.js`

- [x] 23.1 Rooms → `customers:<areaId>`, `admin:<areaId>`. `customer:<userId>` unchanged (a customer
      still also joins that identity room via `joinRoleRoom`, untouched). New `joinAreaRoom(socket)`
      handles the area-scoped joins: customer → `resolveAreaIdForSocketUser` (reused from TASK 17) →
      `customers:<areaId>`; admin → JWT's `areaId` claim (added to `socket.data.auth` in
      `authenticateSocket`, alongside the existing `adminRole`) → `admin:<areaId>`.
- [x] 23.2 `emitToAdmins(areaId, eventName, payload)` and `emitToAllCustomers(areaId, eventName,
      payload)` — both now target `admin:<areaId>`/`customers:<areaId>` instead of the old flat
      `admin`/`customers` rooms. Every call site across the codebase updated (17 files, ~42 sites:
      controllers/riderController.js, settingsController.js, shopAdminController.js,
      shopOwnerController.js, adminRiderController.js, adminController.js, deliveryZonesController.js,
      productController.js; utils/adminNotifications.js, shops.js, riders.js; services/riderAssignment.js,
      shopOrderActions.js; realtime/orderEvents.js, presence.js, shopScheduleSweeper.js) — each one
      threaded through whatever `areaId` was already in local scope (`requireOneArea`'s resolved
      `areaId`, `req.shop.area_id`, `req.rider.area_id`, or the order/count-query row's own `area_id`).
      Two spots needed a genuinely new `area_id` on hand, not just a rename: `orderController.js`'s
      checkout order object (built pre-refetch for speed, never carried `area_id`/`areaId` before —
      now does) and `confirmShopOrder`/`readyShopOrder` in `shopOrderActions.js` (their `COUNT(*)`
      queries gained `MAX(o.area_id) as area_id`, matching `rejectShopOrder`'s pre-existing pattern).
- [x] 23.3 Customer socket joins on connect via `joinAreaRoom` (reusing `resolveAreaIdForSocketUser`,
      same `users.last_area_id → getDefaultArea()` chain and same `NODE_ENV!=='test'` guard as TASK 17's
      presence resolution — actually consolidated into one lookup per connect now, since presence used
      to run this same query a second time independently). **Rejoin on client-pushed area change**: new
      `socket.on('area:changed', { areaId })` handler → `rejoinAreaRoom(socket, newAreaId)`, which leaves
      the stale `customers:<oldAreaId>` room (if any) and joins the new one. No existing client emits
      this event yet — it's new server-side plumbing a future customer-app change (switching delivery
      area mid-session) can call into; documented in the handler's own comment.
- [x] 23.4 A customer socket that resolves no area at all (H7 — cold-start race, or both the
      `last_area_id` lookup and the default-area fallback come up empty) simply joins no
      `customers:<areaId>` room and the connection proceeds normally — `joinAreaRoom` only calls
      `socket.join(...)` inside an `if (areaId)` guard, never blocks or rejects the connection. Admin
      sockets are unaffected either way (JWT-claim-driven, no async lookup on the area_admin path).
- [x] 23.5 `adminRole === 'super_admin'` branch in `joinAreaRoom` calls `areaScope.listAreas()` and
      joins every `admin:<areaId>` room (`socket.data.allAdminAreas = true` marks this for
      debuggability). Unit-tested directly in `tests/socketAreaResolution.test.js` (real e2e coverage
      isn't possible here without a db/mysql mock — see that file's own comment) with 3 real areas,
      confirming all 3 rooms are joined.
- [x] 23.6 Confirmed no event name or payload field changed — grepped every touched emit call site's
      event-name string and payload object literal before/after; only the first positional argument
      (the target room's areaId) was added. `toOrderEventPayload`'s shaped customer/admin payload is
      untouched; `orderEvents.js`'s wrapper functions derive `areaId` from the raw `order.area_id`
      passed in (already stamped on every order since TASK 13), not from anything added to the payload
      itself.
- [x] 23.7 New test in `tests/realtime.test.js` ("an area 2 admin event never reaches an area 1 admin
      socket") — two real socket.io connections (area_admin JWTs with `areaId: 1` and `areaId: 2`),
      `emitToAdmins(2, 'delivery_zones.updated', ...)`, asserts the area 2 socket receives it and the
      area 1 socket never does (`expectNoEvent` with a 75ms grace window, same helper the file's other
      leak tests already used). Same file also gained a same-area delivery test (two area-1 admins both
      receive an area-1 emit) as the direct positive-case complement.

**Test churn (fixing signature-change breakage, not new coverage):** `tests/realtimeEvents.test.js`,
`tests/riderAssignment.test.js`, `tests/ridersUtils.test.js`, `tests/riderUatCoverage.test.js`,
`tests/shopOwner.test.js`, `tests/ridersAdminDelete.test.js`, `tests/shopGlobalStatusSync.test.js`,
`tests/presenceTracker.test.js`, `tests/realtime.test.js` all had `emitToAdmins`/`emitToAllCustomers`
call assertions updated to the new `(areaId, eventName, payload)` shape, with fixtures gaining an
explicit `area_id`/`areaId` where the emit's area now has to come from the mocked row. New/expanded:
`tests/socketAreaResolution.test.js` (added `joinAreaRoom` coverage: customer resolves-and-joins,
customer resolves-to-nothing (H7), area_admin joins from JWT claim with zero DB calls, super_admin
joins every area, no-auth no-op — 5 new cases), `tests/realtime.test.js` (23.7 above, plus the
same-area admin-delivery test).

**Bug caught by this sweep, not by TASK 13:** `orderController.js`'s checkout success path built its
own `order` object literal for `realtimeEvents.emitOrderCreated(order)` rather than re-querying the row
— that literal never included `area_id`/`areaId`, so with `emitToAdmins` now requiring a real areaId to
pick a room, every real "new order" admin notification would have silently gone to `admin:undefined`
(reaching no one) had this not been caught while tracing whether `order.area_id` was actually in scope
at each of `orderEvents.js`'s call sites. Fixed by adding `areaId: deliveryAreaId, area_id:
deliveryAreaId` (the same variable already used two lines below it for `createAdminNotification`'s
`areaId`) to the literal.

**`presence.js` (analytics live snapshot) also updated**, since `emitToAdmins`'s old single-room
signature no longer exists: `emitLiveSnapshot` now emits one `getLiveSnapshot(areaId)` per real area
(unioning `listAreas()` with any area currently present in the in-memory presence Map, so a quiet area
with zero online customers still gets its own zeroed snapshot instead of going stale) to that area's own
`admin:<areaId>` room, instead of one combined snapshot to a flat `admin` room. Necessary follow-on fix:
`peakToday` was previously a single global high-water mark tracked only when `getLiveSnapshot()` was
called with no `areaId` — since every real call now passes one, peak tracking is now split into a
global `peakToday` (unchanged, for direct unfiltered callers) plus a `peakByArea` Map keyed by areaId,
so each area's own admin room sees a peak that's actually its own rather than permanently stuck at 0.

**Live verification:** per-area room targeting is a socket.io connection-level concern (not a MySQL
schema/query change), so — consistent with the plan this session had already set for this task —
verification is the real end-to-end Jest socket suite (`tests/realtime.test.js`) rather than a
standalone DB script: real `http.createServer` + real `socket.io` server + real `socket.io-client`
connections over an actual TCP port, asserting genuine room delivery/non-delivery, not mocked
event-emitter calls. `resolveAreaIdForSocketUser`/`listAreas` DB-touching branches (customer + super_admin
paths) are separately unit-tested against a real query shape in `tests/socketAreaResolution.test.js`.
Full Jest suite: 97/97 suites, 1039/1040 tests, 1 pre-existing skip. `npm run lint`: clean.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 244 (was 247 at TASK 22 — minor drift, not attributable to
this task: sockets carry no SQL, and this guardrail only scans query strings on not-yet-swept tables, so
TASK 23's room-targeting logic contributes nothing to it either way; every query this task touched
already had its `area_id` predicate from earlier tasks — the only SQL change here was adding
`area_id`/`MAX(o.area_id) as area_id` to a couple of SELECT column lists so the row's own area was on
hand for the emit, not a change to any WHERE clause).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 23 — per-area socket rooms`

---

## Phase F — Super admin API + UI

### [x] TASK 24 — Super-admin endpoints, clone-area, the 409 gate
**Spec:** §2.12, §6.6, §6.8 · **Files:** `[api] src/controllers/areaController.js` (new),
`src/routes/adminRoutes.js`, `src/utils/areaScope.js`, `src/db/migrate.js`

- [x] 24.1 `POST /admin/areas` — one transaction (`pool.getConnection`/`beginTransaction`, same pattern
      as `orderController.js`'s checkout transaction) creating the `areas` row, its `settings` row
      (`createSettingsForArea`, ready since TASK 9, called for the first time by this task) and its two
      `is_system` store modes (`seedSystemStoreModes`, already existed in `areaScope.js` since TASK
      11/15 but was likewise never called until now) — all three committed together, or none of them.
      Gave `seedSystemStoreModes` an optional `connection` param (previously always used the module-level
      `pool`) so it can join the same transaction, matching `createSettingsForArea`'s existing
      `connection = pool` pattern. A new area starts with zero categories/products/shops/riders/offers —
      confirmed live (see below).
- [x] 24.2 `GET /admin/areas` (`listAreas()` from `areaScope.js`, already cached) and
      `PATCH /admin/areas/:id` (partial update: name/active/timezone/brand_color/logo_image_id/features).
      Both bust the 60s areas cache — added a small `invalidateAreasCache()` export to `areaScope.js`
      (it only exposed `_resetCachesForTests` before this task) so a just-created/edited area is visible
      to `listAreas()`/`getAreaById()` immediately instead of after the TTL.
- [x] 24.3 `POST /admin/admins`, `GET /admin/admins` (joined to `areas` for `areaCode`), `PATCH
      /admin/admins/:id`. §2.9 role/area invariant enforced in one shared `validateRoleAreaInvariant`:
      `super_admin` must have no `areaId`; `area_admin` must reference a real area (`getAreaById`
      lookup, not just "is it a number"). Password hashed with `bcrypt.hash(password, 10)`, same as the
      existing admin-login bootstrap path in `migrate.js`; minimum 8 characters. `password_hash` is never
      included in any response shape.
- [x] 24.4 **§6.6 gate, shipped in this same commit, not a follow-up:** a new `platform_flags` singleton
      table (`id INT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1, areas_sweep_complete TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`) —
      same one-row-by-convention shape as the existing `admin_auth_state` table — added to `migrate.js`
      right after TASK 22's `units` table, seeded to `0`. `createArea` reads it first, before touching
      anything else, and returns `409 AREAS_SWEEP_INCOMPLETE` if it isn't `1`. Nothing in this task, or
      anywhere else in the codebase, ever sets it to `1` — only TASK 30 will, after its isolation E2E
      passes.
- [x] 24.5 `POST /admin/areas/:id/clone-from/:sourceId` — copies, as brand-new rows with fresh
      auto-increment ids and old-id→new-id maps built along the way: categories (all identity + placement
      fields, `library_category_id` preserved so future propagation still reaches the clone), store modes
      (`INSERT IGNORE` on `uniq_store_modes_area_slug` so the target's own already-seeded `is_system`
      packed/fast_food rows are a no-op and only genuinely custom modes get copied), products **where
      `library_product_id IS NOT NULL`** (local-only products are never cloned — matches §2.5's "opt-in
      per area" model) plus their variants, offers plus `offer_products` (skipped when the referenced
      product wasn't itself a library-linked clone), and `dashboard_sections` plus
      `dashboard_section_items` (category/product/offer items remapped through the same id maps; combo
      items skipped — combos are outside this task's copy scope and there is nothing in the target to
      point at). Optional `priceMultiplier` (default `1`) scales `price`/`original_price`/`shop_price` on
      both products and variants, rounded to 2dp. `shop_id`/`group_id` are deliberately never copied onto
      a cloned product (§2.8 — shops aren't cloned, so a copied `shop_id` would point at nothing, or worse,
      at a different area's real shop).
      **Corrected after the initial commit, before moving on:** the first pass hand-rolled a raw `INSERT
      INTO products` for the library-linked clone instead of calling `materializeToArea` — caught while
      reading §4.5's DRY contract for TASK 25 context (its own header comment in `productLibrary.js`
      literally names "clone-area (TASK 24)" as a required caller, alongside add-from-library and bulk
      add-to-areas). Fixed in a same-day follow-up commit: `cloneArea` now calls `materializeToArea(conn,
      { libraryProductId, areaId, categoryId, price, shopPrice, available, displayOrder, variantPrices })`
      per product — `variantPrices` built from the source's own variants keyed by `library_variant_id`
      (a source variant with no `library_variant_id`, i.e. a local-only customization, has nothing to key
      an override by and is correctly not carried over). This makes identity fields (name, description,
      image, unit, variant labels) come from the **current** library row rather than a frozen snapshot of
      the source area's copy — genuinely correct per §2.5, not just DRY-compliant — and keeps the
      `products.price` ⇄ default-variant mirror invariant enforced in the one place that already owns it
      (`syncProductVariants`, called internally by `materializeToArea`). `original_price`/`discount_label`/
      `featured` are area-owned display fields `materializeToArea` doesn't manage, so those three still get
      a small explicit follow-up `UPDATE` after materialization — everything else routes through the
      shared materializer. Re-verified live end to end with a real library product + variant (see below).
- [x] 24.6 Confirmed by construction, not just by omission: the clone function's own query list touches
      only `categories`, `store_modes`, `products`, `product_variants`, `offers`, `offer_products`,
      `dashboard_sections`, `dashboard_section_items` — `orders`, `order_items`, `users`, `riders`,
      `shops` and `coupons` do not appear anywhere in `cloneArea`.
- [x] 24.7 Clone's first two queries (inside the same transaction as the rest of the copy, before any
      write) count the target's own `categories`/`products` rows; either being non-zero returns `409
      CONFLICT` and rolls back before any INSERT runs — live-verified: cloning twice in a row 409s on
      the second attempt.
- [x] 24.8 `DELETE /admin/areas/:id` is a real, routed endpoint — not a 404 — that always returns `405
      NOT_SUPPORTED` with a message pointing at `PATCH { active: false }` instead.

**Live verification (real local dev DB, not mocked):** ran the actual migration twice (idempotent, no
errors — `platform_flags` table created cleanly, existing Area 1 row untouched) and then drove every
`areaController.js` function directly against the real `pool` with a throwaway script
(`scratchpad/verifyTask24.js`, deleted after use): (1) `POST /admin/areas` correctly 409s
(`AREAS_SWEEP_INCOMPLETE`) while the flag is `0`; (2) flipping `platform_flags.areas_sweep_complete = 1`
(simulating what TASK 30 will eventually do) makes area creation succeed, and the new area's `settings`
row and both `store_modes` rows exist immediately afterward; (3) a duplicate code 409s; (4) `PATCH`
updates and re-reads correctly; (5) `DELETE` 405s; (6) cloning the real seeded Area 1 catalog into the
new area actually copied 9 categories, 3 store modes, 3 offers and 8 dashboard sections (0 products,
correctly — none of Area 1's real seed products are library-linked, since promoting to the library is a
deliberate admin action nothing in this session's seed data has ever performed); (7) cloning again
immediately 409s; (8) creating an `area_admin` bound to the new area, and rejecting a `super_admin`
payload that also set an `areaId`, both worked; (9) `updateAdmin` applied a `displayName` change. Every
row this script created (test area, its settings/store-modes/categories/products/offers/sections, the
test admin) was deleted afterward and the flag reset to `0` — confirmed 0 remain and Area 1 is
unaffected. **Re-verified live a second time** after the `materializeToArea` correction above
(`scratchpad/verifyTask24clone.js`, also deleted after use): created a real `product_library` row + one
`library_variants` row, materialized a linked product into Area 1 by hand, cloned into a fresh area with
`priceMultiplier: 2` — the clone reported `productsCloned: 1`, the cloned row's price was genuinely
90 (45 × 2), its variant carried the correct `library_variant_id` link, and — visible proof the fix
matters — `description` came through as the library row's own text while `unit` came back `null` (this
library row was never given a `unit_id`), confirming identity is now sourced from the current library
row through `materializeToArea`, not copied from the source area's product snapshot. All test rows
(library product, library variant, source product/variant, cloned area and everything under it) deleted
afterward, flag reset to `0`, confirmed 0 remain.

**Test churn:** new `tests/areaController.test.js` (25 cases) — the §6.6 gate at both flag states, the
one-transaction create (asserting `createSettingsForArea`/`seedSystemStoreModes` are called with the
same connection object as the `INSERT INTO areas`, not a fresh `pool.query`), duplicate-code and
mid-transaction-failure rollback, area update/delete, the full clone happy path (asserting the exact
remapped `category_id`/product row shape sent to MySQL, not just the summary counts in the response),
the price-multiplier math, target-not-empty and same-area-id and missing-area 4xx/409s, admin list/create/
update including every role/area invariant branch and the duplicate-username/short-password rejections,
and a super_admin-vs-area_admin 403 check across both route groups. Full Jest suite: 98/98 suites,
1064/1065 tests, 1 pre-existing skip. `npm run lint`: clean.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 247 (was 244 at TASK 23) — `cloneArea`'s child-row reads
(`product_variants` by `product_id` — now only the pre-materialize `variantPrices` lookup, one fewer raw
query than the original hand-rolled version but the same shape — plus `offer_products` by `offer_id` and
`dashboard_section_items` by `section_id`) filter by a parent id that was itself already resolved from an
area-scoped row earlier in the same transaction, the same trusted-child-id pattern already used
everywhere else in this codebase (e.g. variant toggles joining through `products` to confirm area) — the
guardrail's static scan can't see that trust chain and counts them anyway; never a real cross-area leak,
still purely informational/never-failing.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 24 — super admin endpoints, clone-area, creation gate`

### [x] TASK 25 — Admin client, area switcher, all-areas mode
**Spec:** §2.10, §4.4 · **Files:** `[adm] src/api/client.js:15`, `src/layout/AdminLayout.jsx`,
`src/components/AuthProvider.jsx`, a new area store

- [x] 25.1 New `src/stores/areaHeader.js` — a plain (non-React) singleton `client.js` reads from, since
      `client.js` is a bare fetch wrapper with no access to React context. It's gated by role, not just
      by value: `areaHeader.get()` returns the picked area only when `currentAdminRole ===
      'super_admin'`; for anyone else it returns `null` regardless of what's cached, because
      `areaMiddleware.js`'s `resolveAdminArea` (TASK 8) hard-403s an `area_admin` that sends
      `X-Area-Id` **at all** — "rejected, not silently overridden." Without this gate, a stale
      super_admin selection left in `localStorage` from a previous session on a shared browser would
      403 every request the moment a different admin (or the same admin demoted to `area_admin`) logs
      in. `AuthProvider.jsx` calls `areaHeader.setAdminRole(...)` from both `login()` and the boot-time
      `/me` call (see the `me()` backend fix below — without it, a page reload had no way to know the
      logged-in admin's role at all), and `areaHeader.reset()` on logout/401/before a fresh login.
      `client.js` itself just adds one `if (areaId) headers['X-Area-Id'] = areaId` block — the only
      place in the whole app this header is set.
- [x] 25.2 New `AreaSwitcher.jsx` in `Header.jsx` — a `<select>` populated from `GET /admin/areas`
      (TASK 24), with an `All areas` option (`value="all"`), rendering nothing (`return null`) unless
      `useAreaStore().isSuperAdmin`.
- [x] 25.3 New `src/stores/useAreaStore.jsx` (`AreaProvider`/`useAreaStore`, nested inside
      `AuthProvider` in `App.jsx`) owns the area list + current selection. `AdminLayout.jsx` keys the
      routed `<Outlet key={areaId ?? 'none'}>` on the current areaId — switching areas unmounts +
      remounts whichever page is open, so its plain `useEffect(() => { fetch... }, [])` reruns from
      scratch against the new area. Zero changes needed to any of the 23 existing pages for this part.
- [x] 25.4 `Settings.jsx`, `DeliveryZones.jsx` and `StoreModes.jsx` each check `useAreaStore().areaId
      === 'all'` before firing their fetch (skipping it entirely rather than sending a doomed request)
      and render a new shared `<PickAreaNotice/>` component instead of their normal form.
- [x] 25.5 `AreaSwitcher` returns `null` for an `area_admin` (confirmed live: an `area_admin` login
      shows no `<select>` in the header at all). No Areas/Admins/Library pages exist yet (TASK 26) to
      gate.
- [x] 25.6 `AreaProvider`'s boot effect fetches `GET /admin/areas`, then validates
      `areaHeader.getPersisted()` against the real list — `'all'` is always valid; a numeric id must
      still exist in the list. Anything invalid (or nothing persisted yet) falls back to the area with
      `is_default`, never left unset (most admin endpoints 400 a super_admin with no area picked) and
      never silently defaulted to `'all'`. Live-verified: manually setting `localStorage.admin_area_id`
      to a nonexistent id (`999`) and reloading correctly fell back to Area 1, not a 400 loop.

**Bug caught and fixed along the way, not in the original task list:** `adminController.js`'s `me()`
handler returned only `{ id, role: 'admin' }` since long before this multi-area work — `login()`'s own
response already carried `adminRole`/`areaId` (TASK 7), but `/me` (the ONLY path a page reload takes,
since `AuthProvider` calls it instead of re-logging in) never did. Without this fix, `useAreaStore`
would have no way to know a reloaded session belongs to a `super_admin` at all — the switcher would
silently vanish on every refresh. Fixed to mirror `login()`'s `user` shape, reading straight off
`req.admin` (already decoded by `requireAdmin`, no extra DB read). Covered in
`tests/roleProtection.test.js`'s existing area-resolution `/admin/me` cases.

**Second bug caught live, not in the original task list:** the very first version of `AdminLayout.jsx`
keyed the `<Outlet>` on `areaId` but rendered it unconditionally — on the very first render after
login, `AreaProvider`'s own `GET /admin/areas` + boot-validation hadn't resolved yet (`areaId` still
`null`), so the just-mounted page (e.g. `Dashboard.jsx`) fired its own fetch immediately with no
`X-Area-Id` attached at all and got a real `400 X-Area-Id is required` from the server — reproduced live
in the browser before being caught (not from a written test — this class of race only shows up against a
real async boot sequence). Fixed by adding an `areaPending = isSuperAdmin && !initialized` gate in
`AdminLayout.jsx` that renders a small "Loading your areas…" placeholder instead of the `<Outlet>` until
`AreaProvider` has resolved a real area — so every page's very first fetch already carries the right
one. Re-verified live after the fix: fresh login, and a hard reload with a valid token, both loaded the
Dashboard correctly with no console errors.

**Live verification (real browser, real backend, not a stub):** started both the `api-dev` and
`admin-dev` dev servers via the preview tooling, created two throwaway admin accounts directly in the
dev DB (`browsertest_super` / `browsertest_area`, both deleted afterward) since the real seeded
super_admin's password is only known via env vars this session can't read. Walked through, in the
actual rendered app: super_admin login shows the switcher defaulted to Area 1; Settings/Delivery
Zones/Store Modes render normally under Area 1 and correctly show the "Pick an area" notice under "All
areas"; Orders (a page that legitimately supports `all`, §2.10) renders fine under "All areas" with no
error; an `area_admin` login shows no switcher at all and its Dashboard loads normally (no `X-Area-Id`
ever sent — confirmed by the account never hitting `areaMiddleware.js`'s 403); an invalid persisted
`admin_area_id` (`999`) correctly falls back to Area 1 on reload instead of looping on 400s. Both
bugs above were caught by this live pass, not by the (separately green) Jest/lint/build checks. Test
admin accounts and all `localStorage` state cleaned up afterward.

**Test churn:** `npm run lint` (admin app): clean. `npm run build:dev` (production Vite build): clean,
173 modules transformed, no errors — this app has no Jest suite (build + lint + live browser
verification are its equivalent). Backend: `tests/roleProtection.test.js` gained response-shape
assertions on the two existing `/admin/me` cases (area_admin and super_admin) to cover the `me()` fix;
full API suite 98/98 suites, 1064/1065 tests, 1 pre-existing skip, unaffected otherwise.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 25 — admin area switcher and all-areas mode`

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 25 — admin area switcher and all-areas mode`

### [x] TASK 26 — Areas, Admins and Library pages
**Spec:** §2.10, §4.7 · **Files:** `[adm] src/pages/Areas.jsx`, `Admins.jsx`, `Library.jsx` + CSS,
`src/App.jsx`, `src/pages/Products.jsx`

**Backend gap closed first, not in the original file list:** TASK 21 only ever built the edit-sync
direction for the category/store-mode libraries (`propagateCategoryLibraryEdit`/
`propagateStoreModeLibraryEdit`) — there was no create/browse/"add to area" endpoint for either,
unlike the product library (TASK 19). The Library page's Categories/Store Modes tabs are meaningless
without one, so this task added: `materializeCategoryToArea`/`materializeStoreModeToArea` in
`productLibrary.js` (idempotent by `(area_id, slug)`, not just by the library-id link — an `is_system`
store mode like `packed` is already auto-seeded into every area with no library link yet, so "adding"
one from the library backlinks that existing row instead of colliding on
`uniq_store_modes_area_slug`), two new controllers (`categoryLibraryController.js`,
`storeModeLibraryController.js`, sharing a `libraryShared.js` `requireOneArea` with the product one),
and their routes (`/admin/category-library`, `/admin/store-mode-library`, same
GET-any-admin/write-super-admin/add-to-area-own-area shape as `/admin/library`). 20 new test cases in
`tests/categoryStoreModeLibrary.test.js`; live-verified against the real dev DB (create → add-to-area →
identity edit → confirmed the per-area row's name actually changed via propagation), cleaned up after.

- [x] 26.1 `Areas.jsx` — list/create/edit/deactivate, brand colour (native colour picker), logo
      (reuses the same `useImageCropper`/`ImageCropper` upload flow as Categories/Settings), and a raw
      JSON textarea for feature toggles (`areas.features` has no defined schema anywhere in the
      codebase — grepped to confirm zero existing usages — so a generic JSON editor is honest here
      rather than inventing specific flag semantics nothing else defines).
- [x] 26.2 `Admins.jsx` — list/create/edit/deactivate; role dropdown (`area_admin`/`super_admin`) with
      an area picker that only renders for `area_admin` (mirrors the backend's own §2.9 invariant:
      `super_admin` always has `areaId: null`).
- [x] 26.3 `Library.jsx` — one page, three tabs (`Products`/`Categories`/`Store Modes`), a `TABS` array
      mapping each to its own API client rather than three separate page components. Grid cards show
      image (or a placeholder), name/label, slug, variant count (products only), and archived state.
- [x] 26.4 Per-card "Add to area…" targets **the currently selected area** (the global switcher from
      TASK 25 — §4.4 forbids any page from picking its own area, so this is the only coherent reading:
      switch areas via the header, then "add to area" adds to that one). For products, opens a small
      form asking for a categoryId (fetched live from `CategoriesApi.list()`, i.e. real categories in
      the current area) and a price, pre-filled from the library's suggested price. Multi-select +
      "Add N to areas…" bulk action (products tab only — categories/store-modes have no bulk endpoint)
      opens one row per real area (from `AreasApi.list()`) for a categoryId + price each, then calls
      `addToAreas` once per selected product. Documented simplification: since the client cannot send
      an ad-hoc `X-Area-Id` override per request (§4.4's "only place" rule), the bulk form asks for a
      raw categoryId per area rather than fetching each area's own category list inline.
- [x] 26.5 Every card renders `areaIds`/`area_ids` (already returned by all three list endpoints since
      TASK 19/this task) as area-code chips, resolved against the switcher's own already-fetched area
      list.
- [x] 26.6 `Products.jsx` — "📚 Add from Library" button next to "+ New Product", opening a search →
      pick → categoryId/price form that calls the same `LibraryApi.addToArea` the Library page's own
      per-card action uses.
- [x] 26.7 `Products.jsx`'s edit drawer: `isLibraryManaged = Boolean(product.libraryProductId ||
      product.library_product_id)` gates `readOnly` on the name, unit, description and every variant
      label input, disables the image-upload zone (shows "Managed in Library" in its place), and shows
      a banner linking to `/library`. Price, availability, category, shop and display order all stay
      editable — those are area-owned (§2.5).
- [x] 26.8 New `SuperAdminRoute.jsx` (mirrors `ProtectedRoute.jsx`'s shape) wraps `/areas`, `/admins`,
      `/library` in `App.jsx`, redirecting to `/` for a non-super_admin. Sidebar's new "Multi-Area" nav
      group only renders for `isSuperAdmin`.
- [x] 26.9 Confirmed no parallel copies: Categories/StoreModes pages are untouched except for the
      "pick an area" gate already added in TASK 25; `Products.jsx` gained the read-only gating and one
      new button/modal in place, not a second products page.

**Bug caught live while testing, not in the original task list:** none this task — TASK 25's `me()` and
`areaPending` fixes already covered the boot-race classes of bug that would otherwise have surfaced
here too; this task's live pass (creating a real library product, adding it to the real area, editing it
in `Products.jsx`, checking the `area_admin` redirect) found no new ones.

**Live verification (real browser, real backend):** reused the same throwaway `browsertest_super`/
`browsertest_area` accounts from TASK 25 (recreated, deleted again after). Confirmed: Areas page lists
the real Area 1 row; Admins page lists both real admins; Library → Products tab creates a real
`product_library` row, "Add to area…" materializes it into Area 1 with a real category picked from a
live `CategoriesApi.list()` call, and the area-code chip (`A1`) appears immediately after; `Products.jsx`
shows the new product with its variant, and its edit drawer renders the read-only banner with the name
field genuinely `readOnly: true` (checked via `input.readOnly` in the page, not just visually);
`area_admin` login hitting `/library` directly redirects to `/` and shows no "Multi-Area" sidebar group
at all. No new console errors on any of these (only the pre-existing, unrelated Dashboard duplicate-key
warning also present before this task). All test rows and accounts deleted afterward.

**Test churn:** new `tests/categoryStoreModeLibrary.test.js` (20 cases, see the backend-gap note above).
`npm run lint` (admin app): clean. `npm run build:dev`: clean, 178 modules. Backend: full API suite
99/99 suites, 1087/1088 tests, 1 pre-existing skip.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 26 — areas, admins and library admin pages`

## Phase G — Payload optimization + customer app

### [x] TASK 27 — Catalog version, ETags, `/bootstrap`
**Spec:** §3.10, §9.4 item 4 · **Files:** `[api] src/utils/areaScope.js`,
`src/controllers/bootstrapController.js` (new), `src/app.js`, public GET handlers

- [x] 27.1 Verified `bustAreaCaches` (hence `bumpCatalogVersion`) is already reached from every
      catalog/settings/zone write path — categories, combos, coupons, dashboard, delivery zones,
      product/category/store-mode libraries, products, settings, shops all call it. **One real gap
      found and fixed:** `storeModeController.js`'s `createStoreMode`/`updateStoreMode` only ever called
      `invalidateStoreModeCache(areaId)` directly — never `bustAreaCaches`, so a store-mode change
      (which gates which dashboard/products a customer can even reach, §2.4 catalog data) never bumped
      `catalog_version` and would never invalidate an ETag. Fixed by routing both through
      `bustAreaCaches` instead (which already calls `invalidateStoreModeCache` internally, so this is
      also strictly fewer lines). New `tests/storeModeCatalogVersion.test.js` (2 cases) covers it.
- [x] 27.2 New `catalogETag` middleware in `areaScope.js` — `ETag: "<areaId>-<catalogVersion>"`,
      short-circuits to a bare 304 on a matching `If-None-Match`, never blocks the real response if the
      area lookup fails. Mounted after `resolveCustomerArea` on categories, settings, delivery-zones and
      products. **Correctness guard added beyond the checklist's own wording:** `getProducts` and
      `getCategories` both read query params (`search`, `categoryId`, `type`, `isCombo`, `featured`,
      `offerId`, …) that narrow the response body without changing `catalog_version` — applying the flat
      area+version ETag to those would 304 a genuinely different result set. Both routes wrap
      `catalogETag` in a small guard that skips straight to the real handler whenever any such param is
      present, so the ETag only ever applies to the true unfiltered catalog fetch.
- [x] 27.3 New `bootstrapController.js` / `GET /api/bootstrap?latitude=&longitude=` →
      `{ deliverable, area, zone, settings, storeModes, zoneGeometry, catalogVersion }`. Reuses
      `resolveCustomerArea` (same §2.4 chain every other public endpoint already uses) plus three
      extracted helpers — `getSettingsForArea` (from `settingsController.js`), `getActiveStoreModesForArea`
      (from `storeModeController.js`), `getActiveZonesForArea` (from `deliveryZonesController.js`) — so
      `/bootstrap`'s response can never drift from what the standalone endpoints themselves return; it
      calls the exact same cached functions, not a reimplementation.
- [x] 27.4 A pin that resolves to no zone (`req.areaId === null`, exactly `resolveCustomerArea`'s
      existing "pin supplied but matched nothing" signal) returns
      `{ deliverable: false, area: null, zone: null, settings: null, storeModes: [], zoneGeometry: [],
      catalogVersion: null }` — never the default area. A pin genuinely absent from the request still
      falls through `resolveCustomerArea`'s own `last_area_id` → default-area chain, same as every other
      public endpoint (this is the documented "no pin at all" case, distinct from 27.4's "pin supplied,
      matched nothing").
- [x] 27.5 Live-verified against the real dev DB: `settings` in the response carries the resolved
      area's real `upi_id` (`9350238504@mbk`), `upi_qr_image_id`, `support_phone`, `whatsapp_number` —
      exactly what `GET /api/settings` itself returns for that area, since both go through
      `getSettingsForArea`.
- [x] 27.6 Confirmed by the full Jest suite (101/101 suites unaffected) and by hitting the real running
      dev server: every extraction (`getSettingsForArea`, `getActiveStoreModesForArea`,
      `getActiveZonesForArea`) is a pure refactor — the original `getSettings`/`getStoreModes`/
      `listActiveZonesPublic` handlers call the same extracted function and still return byte-identical
      shapes. `/bootstrap` is a new, additive route.
- [x] 27.7 **Measured on the real running dev server, real local dev DB, not an estimate:** old
      cold-start pattern (4 sequential calls — `/api/settings`, `/api/store-modes`,
      `/api/delivery-zones`, `/api/categories`) averaged **~30ms** wall time across 3 runs; the new
      single `/api/bootstrap` call averaged **~3-4ms** — a 4:1 reduction in round trips and roughly an
      8-10x wall-time reduction on localhost, where round-trip latency is near zero. On a real mobile
      network the saving is larger still, since each of the old approach's 4 round trips pays full RTT
      (typically 100-300ms on 3G/4G) on top of server time — this is the case ETags/§3.10 specifically
      calls out. Also confirmed live: a real `ETag: "1-9"` was returned for area 1's actual
      `catalog_version`, and re-requesting with `If-None-Match: "1-9"` correctly 304d with an empty body.

**Bug caught along the way, not in the original task list:** the `storeModeController.js` gap in 27.1
above — a real, previously-silent correctness gap (store-mode edits never invalidated an ETag or bumped
`catalog_version`) that this task's own verification step was specifically designed to catch.

**Live verification (real dev server, real dev DB):** hit the actual running `api-dev` server (already
up on port 3000) directly with `curl` — `GET /api/bootstrap` outside every zone returns
`deliverable:false`; a real coordinate inside area 1's actual `gkp` zone returns the full real payload
(real zone geometry, real settings incl. UPI id, real store modes); the ETag round-trip (fresh fetch →
304 on repeat with the returned `If-None-Match`) was verified against the live server, not just mocked
tests. The 27.7 timing measurement above is from this same live server.

**Test churn:** `tests/storeModeCatalogVersion.test.js` (2 cases, the 27.1 fix), `catalogETag` describe
block added to `tests/areaScope.test.js` (6 cases), new `tests/bootstrapController.test.js` (4 cases).
Full API suite: 101/101 suites, 1099/1100 tests, 1 pre-existing skip. `npm run lint`: clean.

**Guardrail:** informational violation count: 247 (unchanged from TASK 24's fix) — none of this task's
queries touch a not-yet-swept table in a new way; the extracted helpers are the exact same queries the
original handlers already ran, just callable directly.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 27 — catalog version, ETags, bootstrap endpoint`

### [x] TASK 28 — Pin-driven area resolution in the app
**Spec:** §2.4 · **Files:** `[app] src/api/httpClient.js`, `src/api/index.js` (new bootstrap client),
`src/stores/useDeliveryLocationStore.js`, `src/hooks/useDeliveryLocationSync.js`,
`src/screens/customer/HomeScreen/HomeScreen.js`

- [x] 28.1 `useDeliveryLocationSync.js`'s `syncAreaInfo(lat,lng)` calls `bootstrapApi.getBootstrap`
      alongside the existing `checkInsideZone` call (`Promise.all`, both branches: manual-pin re-check
      and live GPS fix) — covers cold start, foreground resume, and every pin change, the same trigger
      set `syncDeliveryLocation` already runs on. Kept separate from `checkInsideZone` deliberately:
      bootstrap's `zone` match doesn't know about exclusion zones, which `checkInsideZone`'s
      `cart/calculate` call does — replacing it would have silently regressed that.
      `HomeScreen.js`'s own `loadHomeData` also calls bootstrap (28.7) for the cold-start/refresh path.
- [x] 28.2 `useDeliveryLocationStore.js` gained `areaId`, `areaName`, `brandColor`, `catalogVersion`
      (zoneId already existed), persisted alongside the pin, cleared together with coords on
      `clearGpsLocation`/`clearManualLocation`. New `setAreaInfo({deliverable, ...})` action — clears
      all four on `deliverable: false` instead of leaving a stale area in place (§2.4).
- [x] 28.3 `dashboardApi.getDashboard`, `settingsApi.getSettings`, `storeModesApi.list` all gained an
      optional `{latitude, longitude}` param (all three routes already ran `resolveCustomerArea`,
      server-side support pre-existed since TASK 11/12/9 — the gap was purely that the client never
      sent the pin). Wired at every call site in `HomeScreen.js` (`loadHomeData`,
      `refreshDashboardSilently`, the background store-mode prefetch) and `CheckoutScreen.js` via a
      stable ref (`deliveryCoordsRef`), never a raw dependency — a live-GPS fix changes on nearly every
      fix (sub-meter jitter) and depending on the coords object directly would refetch on every one of
      those; only an actual zone change (`deliveryZoneId`, unaffected by this task) re-triggers.
      `useStoreModes(coords)` takes the same ref-based approach internally. Search (TASK 22) was
      already area-scoped server-side and untouched here.
- [x] 28.4 No code change needed — already correct. `coldStartGpsApplied`'s `force` flag (fixed
      separately this session, see the cold-start-GPS-default commit) decides which pin wins, and both
      `syncAreaInfo`/dashboard reads go through `useDeliveryLocationStore`'s single `coords`, so the
      area always follows whichever pin actually won. Covered by the existing
      `cartZoneRevalidation.test.js` cold-start describe block.
- [x] 28.5 `syncAreaInfo`/`loadHomeData` both send `If-None-Match: "<areaId>-<zoneId>-<catalogVersion>"`
      (via a shared `buildAreaETag` helper, exported from `useDeliveryLocationSync.js`) built from the
      *previously stored* area+zone+catalogVersion. Found and fixed a real bug in the process: TASK
      27's `bootstrapRoutes.js` mounted the shared `catalogETag` (`<areaId>-<catalogVersion>` only) —
      unlike products/categories/settings/zones, bootstrap's own `zone` field varies by `req.zoneId`
      too (same area, pin moves to a sibling zone, catalog_version unchanged) — a stale 304 would have
      silently kept the client on the old zone. Replaced with a route-local `bootstrapCatalogETag` that
      also keys on `zoneId`. New test: `does NOT 304 a pin that resolved into a different zone in the
      same area, even with the same catalogVersion` in `bootstrapController.test.js`. While fixing this
      also found and fixed a real test-isolation bug in that same file:
      `settingsController.js`'s own 15s `settingsCache` (a *different* module-level cache from the
      ones `areaScope._resetCachesForTests()`/`microCache.clearAll()` already reset in `beforeEach`)
      was carrying a warm cache entry from an earlier test in the file into a later one, silently
      consuming one fewer mocked query and shifting every mock after it — added `bustSettingsCache(1)`
      to `beforeEach`.
- [x] 28.6 `applyBootstrapResult` (shared helper) pushes `result.settings` through the existing
      `normalizeSettings`/`useSettingsStore.setSettings` pipeline — the exact same store
      `ProfileScreen`/`OrderDetailScreen` (support_phone) and `CheckoutScreen` (UPI QR) already read
      from, so no screen-level changes needed there. Also made `CheckoutScreen.js`'s own always-fresh
      `settingsApi.getSettings()` call pin-aware (money-routing correctness, §9.4 item 4) —
      `CheckoutScreen.js` wasn't in this task's named file list but the money-routing risk called out
      in TASK 27's own notes made it worth closing here rather than leaving it as a follow-up gap.
- [x] 28.7 `HomeScreen.js`'s cold-start `settingsPromise` (`settingsApi.getSettings()`) is a clean swap
      for `bootstrapApi.getBootstrap(...)` (same `refresh || isSettingsStale()` gate, same
      `applyBootstrapResult` handler used by 28.1) — it degrades to the exact same
      `users.last_area_id`/default-area fallback as before when there's no pin yet (verified: `GET
      /api/bootstrap` with no `latitude`/`longitude` still returns `deliverable: true` off that same
      chain — `bootstrapController.test.js`'s "no pin at all" case). `dashboardApi.getDashboard()`
      stays its own call (dashboard sections aren't in bootstrap's contract) but is now pin-aware too
      (28.3).

Bugs found and fixed while implementing this task (real bugs, not scope creep):
- `bootstrapRoutes.js`'s ETag wasn't zone-aware — see 28.5.
- `bootstrapController.test.js` had a latent settings-cache test-isolation gap — see 28.5. Was dormant
  before (the affected test was always last in the file, so its leaked mock had nowhere to go);
  surfaced by adding a new test in the middle of the file.
- `httpClient.js`'s `request()` treated any non-2xx status as an error, including 304 — a real fetch
  204 was already special-cased in `parseResponse`, but the `response.ok` gate happens before that and
  would have thrown an `ApiError` on every 304 bootstrap response. Fixed: `response.ok || response.status
  === 304` now both resolve.

Verification: `apps/api` — `npx jest` (101 suites / 1100 tests, 1 pre-existing skip) and `npm run lint`
both clean. `apps/customer-app` — `npx jest --runInBand` (42 suites / 318 tests) and `npx eslint`
(touched files) both clean. Live-verified against the real dev API (port 3000, area 1's `gkp` zone,
lat≈29.443 lng≈75.671): `GET /api/bootstrap` returns `ETag: "1-7-9"`; a repeat with a matching
`If-None-Match` 304s; the same header with a different zoneId (`"1-999-9"`) correctly does NOT 304;
`GET /api/settings?latitude=&longitude=` returns the identical `upi_id`/`support_phone` bootstrap's
`settings` block carries for the same pin; `GET /api/store-modes?latitude=&longitude=` and `GET
/api/dashboard?...&latitude=&longitude=` both resolve area 1 correctly with the pin attached (dashboard
section counts matched the no-pin baseline exactly — 0 sections for `fast_food`, 3 for `packed` — so
adding the params is confirmed non-regressive, not just non-erroring).

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 28 — pin-driven area resolution in the app`

### [x] TASK 29 — Area-change invalidation
**Spec:** §2.4 · **Files:** `[app] src/hooks/useDeliveryLocationSync.js`, `src/stores/useCartStore.js`,
`src/api/realtimeClient.js`, `__tests__/cartZoneRevalidation.test.js`

- [x] 29.1 `applyBootstrapResult` (shared by 28.1's `syncAreaInfo` and 28.7's `HomeScreen.loadHomeData`)
      captures the store's `areaId` *before* calling `setAreaInfo`, then compares it to the resolved
      response's `area.id` — a genuine area-to-area change, not merely `zoneId` moving within the same
      area (two sibling zones in area 1 never trigger this).
- [x] 29.2 New `invalidateForAreaChange(newAreaId)` in `useDeliveryLocationSync.js`, fired only on a
      real area-to-area change: `useCartStore.clearCart()`, `invalidate('products:'|'product:'|
      'categories:'|'dashboard:')` (the generic SWR cache from `utils/apiCache.js` — settings already
      refetch via `applyBootstrapResult`'s existing `useSettingsStore.setSettings`, TASK 28), and a new
      `emitAreaChanged(areaId)` in `realtimeClient.js` (`socket.emit('area:changed', {areaId})`).
      Server-side handling already existed and was already tested (TASK 23's `socket.js`
      `on('area:changed', ...)` → `rejoinAreaRoom`) — this task's only gap was the client never calling
      it; verified the emitted payload shape (`{areaId}`, `Number(...)`-coerced) against the exact
      server handler source before wiring it, no backend change needed.
      "Clear cached search results" (29.2's own wording) needed no separate code: research confirmed
      `ProductListScreen.js`'s search mode reuses the exact same `products:` cache key as category
      browsing (no dedicated search cache exists), and `HomeScreen.js`'s inline dashboard search
      dropdown doesn't cache at all — both already covered by the `invalidate()` calls above.
- [x] 29.3 Enforced by 29.2's `clearCart()` — fires before the customer can act on a newly-resolved
      area, so a cart assembled at the old area's prices never survives to see the new area's zones at
      checkout. (Server-side, order creation already re-resolves the area from the submitted pin and
      re-validates every line against `products WHERE area_id = ?` — TASK 13 — so this is UX-layer
      cleanliness on top of an already-enforced server invariant, not the only thing standing between a
      customer and a cross-area order.)
- [x] 29.4 Already correct, pre-existing, unaffected by TASK 28/29: `HomeScreen.js`'s
      `insideDeliveryZone === false` (from the existing `checkInsideZone`/`cart calculate` chain, not
      bootstrap's own `deliverable` flag) already renders "We don't deliver here yet" instead of any
      catalog — verified this covers both "pin genuinely outside every zone" AND "pin inside a zone but
      an excluded square" (both correctly report `insideZone: false` per `checkInsideZone`'s own
      exclusion-zone handling). TASK 28's `setAreaInfo` clearing `areaId`/`catalogVersion` etc. on
      `deliverable: false` is a complementary correctness improvement (nothing downstream can read a
      stale area while un-deliverable), not a duplicate of this gate.
- [x] 29.5 `__tests__/cartZoneRevalidation.test.js` — new `area-change invalidation (TASK 29)` describe
      block, 4 cases: first-ever resolve (null→id) does NOT clear anything; a genuine area-to-area
      change clears the cart (items + applied coupon), invalidates seeded `products:`/`dashboard:`
      cache entries, and calls `emitAreaChanged`; a same-area zone change does none of that; a pin
      leaving every zone (id→null) does none of that either (29.4's gate handles it, not a cart wipe).
      21 tests total in the file now (was 17 after TASK 28).
- [x] 29.6 No existing reorder feature to retrofit — built it (net new, not previously in the app).
      New `showReorder`/`canReorder`/`blockedReason` via a pure, independently-unit-tested
      `src/utils/reorderEligibility.js`: shown only for a `Delivered` order with items; disabled with
      an explanatory caption when the customer's current resolved area doesn't match the order's own
      `area_id`/`areaId` (comparing areas directly rather than probing per-product existence, since no
      bulk product-check endpoint exists and areas are operationally independent per §9.4 item 2 — a
      mismatch means the order's product ids are certain not to resolve in the current area); also
      disabled (different reason) when the customer has no resolved area yet. Wired into
      `OrderDetailScreen.js`'s existing sticky footer (same row as Cancel/Contact Rider/Help & Support).
      When enabled, tapping it adds every order line to the cart via the existing `useCartStore`
      `addItem`/`addCombo` actions and navigates to Cart — deliberately does NOT re-validate each
      product's live availability itself, reusing Cart's own existing price/availability reconciliation
      (`applyCatalogProductPrices`/`cartApi.calculate`, the same mechanism a zone change already relies
      on) instead of building a second, parallel validation path. New `__tests__/reorderEligibility.test.js`,
      8 cases covering the pure eligibility function.

Verification: `apps/customer-app` — `npx jest --runInBand` (43 suites / 330 tests) and `npx eslint`
(touched files) both clean. No backend changes this task (server-side `area:changed`/`rejoinAreaRoom`
already existed and was already tested under TASK 23) — `apps/api` suite unaffected, not re-run.
Live device/simulator verification wasn't available in this environment (same constraint as TASK
28's client-side work); relied on the same rigor as TASK 28 instead — full test suite, lint, and
direct source-level verification of the client emit payload against the real server handler it targets.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 29 — area-change invalidation`

## Phase H — Verification

### [x] TASK 30 — Cross-area isolation E2E
**Spec:** §6.6, §9.4 · **Files:** `[api] tests/areaIsolation.test.js` (new)

Set up: area 2 with its own admin, shop, rider, zone and catalog.

Two proof mechanisms, deliberately kept separate:
1. **`tests/areaIsolation.test.js`** (new, 17 tests) — calls the REAL production function/route
   (never a re-implementation) with a mocked `pool.query`, seeded with two areas' worth of data,
   asserting on actual SQL text/bound params or actual response shape.
2. **A real, live second area** — created directly in the local dev DB (area id 7, code `A2`,
   bypassing the `areas_sweep_complete` gate deliberately, exactly the scenario the gate exists to
   control), with its own admin (`task30_area2admin`), shop, product, delivery zone, and a cloned
   catalog (via the real `POST /admin/areas/:id/clone-from/:sourceId` endpoint — 9 categories, 3
   store modes, 3 offers, 8 dashboard sections; 0 products cloned because clone-area only clones
   *library-linked* products and `product_library` has never had a row created in it this session —
   correct, not a bug). Verified against the real running dev API (curl) and the real admin Vite dev
   server (Browser tool, logged in as a throwaway super admin). **Fully deleted afterward** — the dev
   DB is back to exactly one area, confirmed by 30.17's row-count re-check below.

- [x] 30.1 `areaIsolation.test.js` — `GET /api/admin/products` with an area-2 `area_admin` JWT
      queries `p.area_id = ?` bound to `2`, never `1` (and the reverse for area 1); the same
      `area_admin` sending `X-Area-Id` is rejected 403 before any query runs (never silently
      honored, never ignored into a leak — `resolveAdminArea`'s own 403, exercised through the real
      route). Live: area 2's admin Products page (Browser tool) showed exactly "Task30 Verify Snack" /
      "Task30 Area2 Shop" — area 1's 9 products and its shop never appeared.
- [x] 30.2 `resolveAreaForPoint` for a pin inside area 1's zone resolves `areaId: 1`; a pin inside
      area 2's zone resolves `areaId: 2` (via the real bbox-prefilter + zone-match chain, not a
      stand-in). Live: `GET /api/products?latitude=40.05&longitude=80.05` (inside the real area-2
      zone) returned exactly 1 product ("Task30 Verify Snack"); a `GET /api/bootstrap` for the same
      pin returned `area.id: 7, area.code: "A2"` with area 2's own `catalogVersion`.
- [x] 30.3 `GET /api/products?search=...` resolved to area 2 queries `area_id = 2` alongside the
      search predicate — structurally cannot return an area-1 row regardless of name match. Live:
      `GET /api/products?search=Task30` from an **area-1** pin returned 0 results (area 2's product
      name is invisible from area 1, not just filtered client-side).
- [x] 30.4 Not re-tested here — this is TASK 29's own job and is already proven in
      `cartZoneRevalidation.test.js`'s `area-change invalidation (TASK 29)` describe block (cart
      clear + SWR cache invalidate + socket `area:changed` emit on a genuine area-to-area move).
- [x] 30.5 Not re-tested here — already proven in `bootstrapController.test.js`'s "a pin outside
      every zone..." case (`deliverable: false`, never a catalog, never the default area).
- [x] 30.6 `listEligibleRiders({areaId: 2})` queries `r.area_id = 2`, never `1` (and the reverse) —
      the real function `riderAssignment.js`'s offer-creation path calls with `areaId: order.area_id`,
      so an area-2 order can only ever reach this query with `areaId: 2`.
- [x] 30.7 `bustAreaCaches(2)` — real function, real `microCache` — clears only
      `dashboard:2:fast_food`, leaves `dashboard:1:fast_food` untouched; its one SQL call
      (`UPDATE areas SET catalog_version...`) is bound to `[2]` only. `emitToAllCustomers`'s room
      name is a direct `customers:${areaId}` template — structurally cannot address another area's
      room. (Real Socket.IO room delivery itself was already exercised under TASK 23's own tests —
      not re-proven here.)
- [x] 30.8 `validateCoupon({code: 'SAVE10', areaId: 1})` and `({code: 'SAVE10', areaId: 2})` resolve
      two **different** coupon rows (different id, different discount rule) via
      `WHERE code = ? AND area_id = ?` — the same code independently defined per area, not a shared
      global row.
- [x] 30.9 `generateOrderNumber` for area 1 and area 2 on the same date, same raw sequence number,
      produce `OD-<date>-A1-0001` vs `OD-<date>-A2-0001` — never equal, by construction (the area
      code is baked into the string, and `daily_order_counters`' own `PRIMARY KEY (area_id,
      counter_date)` gives each area an independent counter). Static check: grepped every
      `UPDATE orders SET ...` in `orderController.js` — `order_number` is never in a SET list, so no
      code path can rewrite an existing order's number. Live: real orders in the dev DB predating
      this migration (`OD-20260703-0001`, `SL-DEMO-1000`, ...) still carry their original,
      un-migrated format — confirms this by construction, not just by the grep.
- [x] 30.10/30.13 `materializeToArea` called twice for the same `libraryProductId` with different
      `areaId`/`price` — both INSERTs share `name`/`description`/`image_id` (read from the same
      `product_library` row) but carry independent `price` and produce genuinely separate `product`
      rows (separate ids). Area independence (30.13) follows directly: `products.price` is a
      per-row column with no propagation trigger touching other areas' rows — only identity fields
      ever propagate (next point).
- [x] 30.11 `propagateLibraryEdit`'s identity `UPDATE products SET name = ?, description = ?,
      image_id = ?, unit = ?` — column list checked directly against the query text, `price` is not
      and can never be in it (an `UPDATE` can only touch its own SET list). Returns
      `areaIds: [1, 2]` from a real `SELECT DISTINCT area_id FROM products WHERE library_product_id
      = ?` — reaches every area carrying the item, not just one.
- [x] 30.12 Same shape, `propagateCategoryLibraryEdit`'s `UPDATE categories SET name = ?, slug = ?,
      type = ?, image_id = ?` — `display_order` structurally absent from the column list.
- [x] 30.14 `getSettingsForArea(1)` vs `getSettingsForArea(2)` — real function, real per-area
      `settingsCache` — resolve genuinely different `upi_id`/`support_phone`. Live (the strongest
      proof, §9.4 item 4's actual concern): `GET /api/bootstrap` for the area-2 pin returned
      `settings.upi_id: "area2verify@upi"`, `settings.support_phone: "7770009999"` — the exact
      values seeded for area 2's `settings` row, never area 1's real `9350238504@mbk` / real support
      number.
- [x] 30.15 Browser-verified (Vite admin dev server, logged in as a throwaway super admin) rather
      than mechanically clicking all 23 pages — a representative, highest-signal set: **Areas**
      (lists A1 + A2 with A2's brand color), **Admins** (lists both throwaway admins with A2's
      `area_admin` correctly bound), **Library** (loads, empty — correct, nothing in
      `product_library`), **Products** (area-2 selection shows only area-2's product; area-1
      selection unaffected), **Shops** (area-2 selection shows only area-2's shop), **Delivery
      Zones** (area-2 selection shows only area-2's zone). Also checked the "All areas" switcher
      option: correctly `400`s on per-area management endpoints (Dashboard, Products) rather than
      leaking or crashing — matches §2.10's "callers that can't operate cross-area reject `all`
      themselves," a clean rejection (not a 500) confirmed via network-request inspection.
- [x] 30.16 **Known, deliberately-scoped-out gap — not glossed over.** The static guardrail
      (`tests/areaScoping.test.js`) is green, but its `SWEPT_TABLES` allowlist only formally covers
      3 of 19 scoped tables (`settings`, `delivery_zones`, `delivery_exclusion_zones`) — a artifact
      of Phase C never going back to expand it as later tasks landed. Running the scanner against
      all 19 tables (not just `SWEPT_TABLES`) surfaces 250 flagged call sites across
      `adminController.js`, `riderController.js`, `orderController.js` and others. Spot-checking a
      sample (`UPDATE riders SET is_online = ? WHERE id = ?` keyed by the rider's own authenticated
      primary key; `orders WHERE rider_id = ?` relying on rider→area being fixed at assignment time)
      suggests most are false positives the heuristic can't see through — safe by construction via
      an id/foreign-key invariant rather than an inline `area_id` predicate — but that was not
      verified site-by-site. Raised to the user directly rather than silently expanding
      `SWEPT_TABLES` with unverified justifications or spending unplanned effort triaging 250 sites;
      the user's explicit direction was **behavioral E2E as the real proof** (this file, plus the
      live area-2 verification above) with the static sweep tracked as separate follow-up debt, not
      a TASK-30 blocker. `git grep -n "TODO\|FIXME" tests/areaScoping.test.js` — none; this gap is
      structural (an allowlist that was never grown), not a marked TODO anyone forgot.
- [x] 30.17 Re-ran the exact TASK 0 baseline query (`products`/`orders`/`users`/`shops` row counts)
      against the real dev DB: `products=9, orders=79, users=6, shops=1` — identical to TASK 0's
      recorded baseline. Spot-checked the first orders by id: `OD-20260703-0001`/`OD-20260703-0002`
      (pre-migration format, unprefixed) and `SL-DEMO-1000..1002` (legacy demo format) — both
      untouched, confirming order numbers are never rewritten (matches 30.9's static proof). Product
      prices (`Demo Burger ₹150`, `Coca Cola ₹200`, etc.) unchanged from their original seed values.
      Re-ran after the area-2 verification's cleanup, not before — this is the check that the
      cleanup actually left zero residue, not just a rerun of TASK 0's own snapshot.
- [x] 30.18 `UPDATE platform_flags SET areas_sweep_complete = 1 WHERE id = 1` — run directly against
      the dev DB only after every item above passed and the live area-2 verification was fully torn
      down (confirmed via 30.17). `migrate.js`'s own comment on this table says as much: "this task
      only reads it, nothing here ever sets it to 1" — the flip is deliberately a manual, one-time
      action outside the migration path, not a new admin-facing endpoint.

Verification: `apps/api` — `npx jest` (102 suites / 1118 tests, 1 pre-existing skip) and `npm run lint`
both clean. `tests/areaIsolation.test.js` itself hit the same recurring mock-queue-leakage pitfall as
earlier this session (a test whose real code path consumed fewer queries than its queued mocks left
the remainder to silently corrupt the next test) — root-caused to `resolveAreaForPoint`'s bbox
prefilter genuinely excluding area 1 as a candidate for an area-2 pin (one candidate, one zone query,
not two), fixed at the source, and switched the file's `beforeEach` to `resetAllMocks()` (documented
inline) so a future imbalance fails loudly in the offending test instead of silently corrupting
whichever test happens to run next.

**Commit:** `feat: AREA TASK 30 — cross-area isolation E2E`
