/**
 * Checkout bug, confirmed live on a real device via adb logcat instrumentation
 * (not just source reading): dragging the delivery pin into a zone that
 * doesn't stock the item currently in cart returns it in the calculate
 * response's unavailableItems, removeUnavailableItems empties the cart, and
 * checkoutItems.length drops to 0. The pricing effect re-fires, hits its
 * checkoutItems.length === 0 early-return branch, and that branch reset
 * bill/calcError/freeDelivery state but never isCalculating — which had been
 * left true by whichever run was in flight. Nothing was ever going to flip
 * it back: "Please wait, checking delivery…" spun forever with zero pending
 * work and zero network requests, confirmed by logging { items: [] } at the
 * exact moment of the hang.
 *
 * Source assertion, matching this codebase's style for screens/components
 * that pull in native map modules jest can't render (see
 * LocationPicker.zoneZoom.test.js, CheckoutScreen.gpsErrorReason.test.js).
