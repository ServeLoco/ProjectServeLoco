/**
 * Shop-owner alert reliability sweeper.
 *
 * Fixes the "shop owner's phone has weak signal" gap: notifyShopsForOrder
 * (utils/shops.js) fires exactly once when an order is Accepted. If that one
 * socket emit + FCM/Expo push doesn't land (dead socket, FCM stuck in Doze,
 * a data-only message dropped by the carrier), the order just sits waiting
 * for a shop that never heard about it — no retry, no admin visibility.
 *
 * Two passes per tick, same shape as riderOfferSweeper.js:
 *  1. remindPendingShopOrders — re-push the alarm to any shop that still
 *     hasn't confirmed/rejected, throttled by SHOP_ALERT_REMIND_MS so a
 *     bursty weak connection gets caught by a later retry.
 *  2. timeoutRejectStaleShopOrders — after SHOP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS of total
 *     silence from a shop, auto-reject that shop's items (same effect as the
 *     owner pressing Reject) so the order stops stalling indefinitely.
 *
 * DB is source of truth (orders.accepted_at, order_items.shop_last_notified_at)
 * — no in-memory timer state, so this is safe across restarts and multiple
 * API instances, same rationale as riderOfferSweeper.
