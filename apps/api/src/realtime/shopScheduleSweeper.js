/**
 * Periodic sweeper for shop auto-open/auto-close schedules (shops.open_time /
 * close_time). Boundary-triggered, not a window check: it only flips is_open
 * the exact minute the clock matches a set time, and only if the shop isn't
 * already in that state — so a manual toggle made any other time of day is
 * never fought (same reasoning as riderOfferSweeper's DB-is-source-of-truth
 * poll, just on a coarser interval since a minute of slack is fine here).
